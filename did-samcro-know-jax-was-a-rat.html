The moment that Jax’s face turned to a smile in the paddy wagon as he got word that the plan none of us saw coming had worked: Turns out the club knew, probably all along, about him turning <b>rat</b> with Agent Stahl to clear Gemma and get their sentence reduced to three years (14 months with good behavior).</p><p>Herein, What happens to the female agent in Sons of Anarchy?</p><p>During this confrontation Stahl breaks down crying and begs Opie for her life, to which Opie responds, “This is what she felt.” He then <b>shoots Stahl in the back of the head with a MAC-10</b>, instantly killing her, to avenge the death of his wife Donna.</p><p>Accordingly, Does Stahl betray Jax?</p><p>Opie then sits Stahl in her car, who breaks down when she realizes she’s about to die. … <b>Jax never betrayed his club</b> and their doublecross of Stahl was planned from the beginning, with Jax’s deal meaning they only serve a year in jail.</p><p>Who is the traitor in Sons of Anarchy?</p><p><b>Charles ‘Charlie’ Barosky</b> was a corrupt ex-cop and the leader of a gang of corrupt Stockton Police Department officers on the FX original series Sons of Anarchy. Played by American actor Peter Weller, Charlie makes his debut on the episode “Straw” in the series’ sixth season.</p><p>Consequently Who ratted out the MC to Lin?</p><p>Most of us had assumed for many episodes now that <b>Jury White</b> — from the Indian Hills chapter of SAMCRO — had turned on Jax and ratted him out to Lin and the Chinese, which led to them killing all of the women in Diosa. But Jury gave a very, very convincing statement otherwise: Yes, he wanted Jax dead, but he is no rat.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_does_Otto_do_to_Tara></span><strong>What does Otto do to Tara?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He’d been an angel with her to this point, so she acquiesced. Otto then manipulated the situation to get Tara out of the room long enough for <b>him to use the crucifix to attack one of the prison nurses</b>. Before the guards could get there to subdue him, he savagely stabbed her in the neck with it until she was dead.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_happened_to_prospects_girlfriend></span><strong>What happened to prospects girlfriend?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jax broke her out and helped her <b>escape California</b> after she made love one last time to Half-Sack. She fled to Belfast. Cherry is staying with Keith McGee and his wife, working in their store in Belfast. … She was devastated after learning about Half-Sack’s death.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Tara_divorce_Jax></span><strong>Does Tara divorce Jax?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Sons Of Anarchy’: Jax Finds Out All About Tara’s Plan To Escape Him And The Club (VIDEO) … Tara wants out, Jax,” she told him. “<b>She’s filing for divorce</b>, and she’s going to take your boys away from you.” She then told Jax to find someone who would tell him the truth, knowing that he was unlikely to take her word for it.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Otto_turn_rat></span><strong>Does Otto turn rat?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He was quite an intelligent man, often reading books in prison. His one weakness however was his wife Luann who he asked the club to look after as his only favor. <b>After she was killed, he ratted on the club for failing to look after her but later regretted turning</b> and sought to make it right.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_killed_Piney_SOA></span><strong>Who killed Piney SOA?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Piney is the third member of the First 9 to be killed by <b>Clay</b> (With JT and Keith McGee being first and second, respectively). Along with his son Opie, and later Gemma, and Unser, Piney is one of only four main characters to appear as a corpse in an episode after they are killed off.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_is_Tig_mad_at_Kozik></span><strong>Why is Tig mad at Kozik?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>When Kozik and NOMAD biker Happy show up at SAMCRO with transfer papers, Happy is accepted but Kozik isn’t as Tig vetoed the vote due to lack of trust. … Kozik is revealed to have <b>a contentious relationship with Tig</b> and, in Episode 3.8, Tig states that the contention involves a female from both of their pasts.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_kills_Lin_in_SOA></span><strong>Who kills Lin in SOA?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On camera, Lin confesses to excommunicated SAMCRO member <b>Juice</b> Ortiz that Barosky is the rat (after Jax has already accused and killed Indian Hills President Jury White). Then Juice stabs Lin in the throat with a shiv, killing him.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_juice_a_rat></span><strong>Is juice a rat?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Gemma drives Juice out to the desert. She knows he is becoming more and more unstable, and she is unsure of what to do with him. … But instead, Alvarez turns Juice over to SAMCRO in the end of the episode as “<b>He’s a rat</b> and we don’t help rats”. The next episode, Jax surprisingly gives Juice back his kutte.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_does_Jax_do_to_Lin></span><strong>What does Jax do to Lin?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>When one of the Chinese hops into a delivery truck and tries to make a fast getaway, Jax chases him down, crashes into his truck and shoots him in the head after learning that <b>the heroin</b> in the brief case is Lin’s. In the end, SAMCRO splits the guns and heroin they took from the trade 50/50 with Indian Mills.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_happened_to_Colette_Sons_of_Anarchy></span><strong>What happened to Colette Sons of Anarchy?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Played by American actress Kim Dickens, Colette makes her debut on the episode “Straw” in the series’ sixth season. Playing a recurring role through the series’ sixth and seventh seasons, <b>Colette met her demise on the episode “Some Strange Eruption”</b> in the series’ seventh, and final, season.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_juice_become_a_rat></span><strong>Does juice become a rat?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In the episode “Smoke ’em if You Got ’em”, Juice attempts to trade intel about SAMCRO to Marcus Alvarez in exchange for transport to Mexico. But instead, Alvarez turns Juice over to SAMCRO in <b>the end of the episode as “He’s a rat and we don’</b>t help rats”.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Otto_bite_off_his_tongue></span><strong>Why did Otto bite off his tongue?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He went as far as to bite off his own tongue in <b>order to show that he is still loyal to SAMCRO</b>, and as a statement to Lee Toric that he would never rat again.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_does_Otto_do_with_the_cross></span><strong>What does Otto do with the cross?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Otto <b>takes out the crucifix as she begs him not to hurt the nurse</b>. “Sons live, Redwood bleeds,” he says as he plunges the crucifix into the nurse’s jugular over and over again. Finally, guards come and pull him off her and take Otto away, but the damage is done.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Otto_rat_on_Bobby></span><strong>Does Otto rat on Bobby?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>When Lincoln Potter was trying to build a RICO case against SAMCRO, he tried to get Otto to be an informant.

But there’s a look in Jax eyes that’s troubling. It doesn’t seem like Jax will ever be making the trip. At the prison, Juice finds himself in the infirmary surrounded by Triad members.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_is_Abel_in_Belfast></span><strong>Why is Abel in Belfast?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>SAMCRO went to Northern Ireland to track him down. Father Kellan Ashby put <b>Abel up for adoption to a “good catholic” family</b>. … After his father, Jax, went to prison, Wendy allowed Tara to become Abel’s guardian, though she did not sign away all parental rights.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Jax_give_Abel_up></span><strong>Does Jax give Abel up?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After tracking his son down, Jax discovered that Abel had been adopted by a young couple with a stable life. <b>Jax actually decided to let Abel go</b>, though he later found out that the family was murdered in cold bold.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Tara_pregnant_when_Gemma_killed_her></span><strong>Was Tara pregnant when Gemma killed her?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>While visiting Gemma when she was on the run, Tara <b>helped Gemma kill her father’s caregiver</b> and Tig helped them cover it up.

Tara doesn’t want the boys to have any contact with SAMCRO, and this includes any contact with Jax. They may have had their ups and downs, but to keep him from seeing his children is a bit much.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Tara_fake_her_pregnancy></span><strong>Why did Tara fake her pregnancy?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Last week, Jax (Charlie Hunnam) learned that Tara (Maggie Siff) faked her pregnancy — and a <b>miscarriage</b> — as part of an elaborate scheme to keep Gemma (Katey Sagal) from being able to gain custody of Jax and Tara’s sons should Tara end up in jail for the charges pending against her.</p><h2><strong></strong></h2><p>Last Updated: 13 days ago – Authors : 17 – Contributors : 10 – References : 29 interviews and posts; 14 Videos.</p><p>Discover all about your fav. celebs at <a href=# rel=noopener>Celebrity Interviews</a> and don’t forget to share this post !</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1ksaqwjKyYppuipHqsus6wZKOZqGLEor%2BMmmSrmaRk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-samcro-know-jax-was-a-rat.html&text=Did%20Samcro%20know%20Jax%20was%20a%20rat%3f%20%20Celebrity.fm%20%20%231%20Official%20Stars%2c%20Business%20%26amp%3b%20People%20Network%2c%20Wi&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-samcro-know-jax-was-a-rat.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-samcro-know-jax-was-a-rat.html&title=Did%20Samcro%20know%20Jax%20was%20a%20rat%3f%20%20Celebrity.fm%20%20%231%20Official%20Stars%2c%20Business%20%26amp%3b%20People%20Network%2c%20Wi" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-samcro-know-jax-was-a-rat.html&title=Did%20Samcro%20know%20Jax%20was%20a%20rat%3f%20%20Celebrity.fm%20%20%231%20Official%20Stars%2c%20Business%20%26amp%3b%20People%20Network%2c%20Wi" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-samcro-know-jax-was-a-rat.html&title=Did%20Samcro%20know%20Jax%20was%20a%20rat%3f%20%20Celebrity.fm%20%20%231%20Official%20Stars%2c%20Business%20%26amp%3b%20People%20Network%2c%20Wi" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-samcro-know-jax-was-a-rat.html&description=Did%20Samcro%20know%20Jax%20was%20a%20rat%3f%20%20Celebrity.fm%20%20%231%20Official%20Stars%2c%20Business%20%26amp%3b%20People%20Network%2c%20Wi" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./senior-year-rebel-wilson-netflix-film-plot-cast-release-date.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Everything you need to know about Rebel Wilson's new teen comedy Senior Year">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./did-lebron-james-transplant-his-hair.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Lebron James Transplant His Hair?
