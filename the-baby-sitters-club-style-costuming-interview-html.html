Martin books, which devoted paragraphs to scrunchies-to-sneakers descriptions of the BSC girls’ outfits, fashion is a crucial part of the ten-episode <a href=#>Baby-Sitters Club Netflix series</a>, which kicks off with the BSC origin story — <a href=#>Kristy’s Great Idea!</a> — and follows the girls through the summer after seventh grade. Summers’s challenge: Staying true to the styles of the beloved characters from the ’90s while bringing the babysitters to the present day.&nbsp;(Well, almost to the present day. There’s no COVID in Stoneybrook.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5quvl000z3h6eizf00bzz@published data-word-count=130>“We definitely wanted to make sure that, whenever we could, we’d give a nod to the style of the ’90s and even some of the book covers,” Summers said by phone. (You may have noticed that the staging of one of the <a href=#>first press photos</a> from the series is a nod to <a href=#>the cover of the first BSC book</a>.) It helped that some of the characters were into vintage clothing — sorry, but yes, the ’90s qualifies as vintage now — and that ’90s styles are back, with some tweaks and twists. And though Summers didn’t grow up with the books, her daughter did, and “so many [of my crew] are from that generation that read them originally.” Read on for Summers’s breakdown of dressing a new generation of babysitters.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckcc5quk4000w3h6e2k52rkax@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Claudia Kishi</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/696/e5c/5551d70c337c5fb2df92dc200e0850a58d-baby-sitters-club-costume-design-2.rvertical.w570.jpg> The one and only Claudia Kishi (Momona Tamada), forever fashion icon.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5quy200103h6e3b6q4qm5@published data-word-count=4><strong>Played by: </strong>Momona Tamada</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qv2d00133h6ei2oyoue3@published data-word-count=51><strong>The look: </strong>As all BSC fans know, Claudia is an artist and her wardrobe reflects her eclectic, pop-bright sensibility. Paragraphs in each book were dedicated to detailing her outfits, which were always vivid, unique, and, objectively, the coolest. <a href=#>Entire fandoms</a> were built around taking inventory of Claudia’s closet, cataloguing every look.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qv5a00153h6et698hyhn@published data-word-count=102>“The fun part of Claudia is she looks in her closet every day — whatever she is feeling that moment, she dresses to it,” Summers said. “And it’s not standard fare, obviously. It’s crazy tops that she’ll put with these pants that are mismatched, but everything she puts together works. She has a great eye. She’s an artist!” For instance, Claudia has a pair of coveralls that, if you watch closely, get more and more paint on them as the season goes on — at first incidentally and then later deliberately, as she doodles on her clothes to make them more her.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qv7r00163h6e6qcc8c2n@published data-word-count=96><strong>The story: </strong>Tamada is “very petite,” Summers said — a good four inches shorter than her fellow club members. So Summers had Claudia wear lots of platform shoes and boots — very on brand for the larger-than-life Claud, plus it got her “on the eyeline with the rest of the girls.” (“Her bun was part of the whole thing too,” Summers added. High buns! Useful advice.) “Everything was a little oversize on her, so we’d belt things … and roll up her pants to be a few inches above the ankles to give her better proportions.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qvax00173h6ee556xth6@published data-word-count=108>Claudia’s room is BSC headquarters, so Summers made sure to have “pieces of fabric lying around her bedroom that were from outfits that she wore, so you could see that she made and created some of her pieces.” Subverting the (honestly overrated) counsel of Coco Chanel <a href=#>who supposedly advised</a> would-be chic women to look in the mirror before leaving the house and take one thing off, Claudia piles on the accessories. A go-to for her was <a href=#>Konplott</a>, because “a lot of their jewelry can be vintage-inspired looking, but it’s also bright and fanciful, and that also worked with our age demographic and the standoutness of Claudia,” Summers said.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qvd200183h6ejxhs4oze@published data-word-count=109>The vision board for Claudia’s aesthetic was “kind of amazing,” Summers said. It was built around an illustration from one of the book covers, magazine tear-outs, and Japanese-American art. Speaking of which: Because Claudia’s family is Japanese-American, they adhere to the Japanese tradition of removing their shoes when they come in the house. Which, for a costume designer, “was really hard for me at first,” Summers said, laughing, “because I really dressed them from head to toe,” but all the girls would have to be shoeless whenever the BSC met in Claudia’s room. So keep an eye out for some interesting socks and for Claudia’s red fluffy kitten-heel slippers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ebf/b00/0cc711e93622d83fd94de4fcef0c89fbb6-baby-sitters-club-recap-ep-09-placeholde.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Yes, those pants are a nod to Alicia Silverstone’s unforgettable Clueless yellow plaid.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qvi500193h6e8brrk267@published data-word-count=114><strong>A ’90s Easter egg for you: </strong>In the premiere, we go from a scene with Kristy acknowledging that her mom — played by Alicia Silverstone — “isn’t totally clueless” (!) to a BSC meeting in which Claudia is wearing pants in that iconic Cher Horowitz yellow plaid. I thought I was possibly hallucinating this/outing myself as a borderline-psychotic fan of Clueless, but Summers assures me that this was all 100 percent intentional. “Once we did get Alicia, and got into Claudia and the color and prints and fantasticness of who she is, yes, it is totally a nod to Clueless, and to her character Cher, and to <a href=#>my friend and amazing designer Mona May</a>.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckcc5qur5000y3h6ekv9zacdo@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Kristy Thomas</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/dbc/f24/ae39306eb26715e3b3f5d8606141955f06-baby-sitters-club-costume-design-4.rvertical.w570.jpg> Kristy “No Muss, No Fuss” Thomas (Sophie Grace)<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qvno001a3h6ejs0o2a4w@published data-word-count=4><strong>Played by: </strong>Sophie Grace</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qvqy001b3h6eydq50bse@published data-word-count=26><strong>The look: </strong>A forever tomboy.

It’s about functionality for Kristy … She’s no muss, no fuss.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qw2q001d3h6ebcru67jd@published data-word-count=51>Though Kristy’s mom is marrying Watson (Mark Feuerstein), whose affluence is both appealing and unsettling for the Thomas clan, Kristy’s attire reflects her single mom’s relatively strapped circumstances: She repeats outfits more than the other girls and wears Stoneybrook Middle School sweatshirts that could easily be swiped from her brothers’ closets.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qw52001e3h6e13p1dodr@published data-word-count=101><strong>Her biggest style moment: </strong>For <a href=#>her mom’s wedding</a>, Kristy gets a bridesmaid’s dress — a total departure from everything we’ve seen her wear up to that point. “We wound up with a dress that really brought out a side of Kristy that she didn’t even know was there,” Summers said. “You can see her standing up straighter and starting to actually admire herself and see her shape, because she’s usually in sweatshirts. She’s in this pale sky blue, which has a really beautiful criss-cross back to it. It’s simple but a little more body-revealing than her character would probably ever do.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6fa/24a/7a606cd905cdfd69bb04b5bb417ffb6192-baby-sitters-club-recap-ep-08.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Kristy’s bridesmaid’s dress for her mom’s wedding “really brought out a side of Kristy that she didn’t even know was there,” says Summers.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qw7f001f3h6e7trl4dez@published data-word-count=73>“It’s an awkward thing when you’re a girl who doesn’t wear dresses to have to go out and find something formal and floor length,” Summers said. “It was a real and joyous moment for all of us. And I think it really helped that all the girls got dressed up” (because, of course, all the members of the BSC are invited to the wedding), “which made it easier for Kristy and for Sophie.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckcc5quz600113h6eeni5e8e3@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Mary Anne Spier</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fed/34e/a71e0e38a81fbd9373ed12f9faf445295c-baby-sitters-club-costume-design-3.rvertical.w570.jpg> The Old Mary Anne (Malia Baker), pigtails, pinafore, and all.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qw9q001g3h6ev7a1c5j0@published data-word-count=4><strong>Played by: </strong>Malia Baker</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qwfq001h3h6eakfxtywy@published data-word-count=80><strong>The look: </strong>Mary Anne has the biggest fashion evolution of all the girls, going from the almost parodically juvenile attire forced on her by her father to freer, more mature clothes that she actually gets to pick out for herself. “I still can’t believe her dad was dressing her the way he was in the grade she was in,” Summers said. “She’s still wearing pigtails and knee socks and pinafores! Even her rolly backpack. It’s just, like, seriously? Poor girl.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qwio001i3h6e4v01177w@published data-word-count=42>Even as Mary Anne found her new look, “we had to stay within our parameters of the original look of her … [but] show that she’s a young girl and not a baby.

In the Netflix series, Mary-Anne is biracial, and this adds a layer to her father’s behavior — much of his rigidity is rooted in his insecurity and fear about trying to prepare his daughter for the world when he is terrified about how cruelly the world could treat her.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qwoc001k3h6eqyuvi007@published data-word-count=92>“She hasn’t changed since her mom passed away, and her dad can’t move on,” Summers said. “And the growth from there had to be something that’s believable. If she turned into a Claudia or Stacey, her dad would clearly never let her out the door.” So Mary Anne’s evolution is a little more subtle: “We took the silhouette and just made them a little more figure-flattering, for starters. The pinafores became a skirt, and it’s a little bit shorter … We added a blouse or a sweater with some style in it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ba9/de9/7230c2b7357f9d6a4bce69fa6e9e11d650-bsc-3.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> “Maybe the biggest part of the story for [Mary Anne] and her dad letting her be herself is her taking her hair out of her braids.”<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qwr5001l3h6emxpeptzz@published data-word-count=85>But the biggest change for Mary Anne is her hair. “I think that’s brilliant because, as we know, Black girls’ hair is everything,” Summers said. “And maybe the biggest part of the story for her and her dad letting her be herself is her taking her hair out of her braids, wearing it down and up in different ways. It was a really wonderful opportunity for her to express herself … Plus, Malia has the most amazing head of hair. It’s just gorgeous and beautiful.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckcc5qv1g00123h6eawt2dtja@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Stacey McGill</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/d27/745/69513934665d6619be22ec77f3d41d149a-baby-sitters-club-costume-design-1.rvertical.w570.jpg> Motorcycle jacket?

Sometimes she’d have a scarf wrapped around her neck in a way that would not be odd on a 25-year-old but “you don’t see a lot of kids in school dressed like that.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qx3h001p3h6e4g3fgpir@published data-word-count=48>Stacey has diabetes (this comes up frequently in the books … her blood sugar is basically a junior member of the BSC), so it was also necessary to incorporate her insulin pump, “which got bedazzled by the prop department in colors that worked with her palette,” Summers said.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qxhy001q3h6elpyal32l@published data-word-count=45>Even though Stacey is the boy-craziest of the bunch, she’s “still in that mind-set of: I’m a girl; I dress for girls. And she’s in the mind-set of: I’m Stacey, and I dress as Stacey,” Summers said. “She never really changes her New York style.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckcc5qv3n00143h6edrsbl41n@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Dawn Schafer</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/31e/708/50759c13cf79caadde594caea351a7bf3e-baby-sitters-club-costume-design-5.rvertical.w570.jpg> Dawn (Xochitl Gomez) represents the biggest style departure from the books — less surfer, more skater.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qxk8001r3h6ebeqx5lft@published data-word-count=4><strong>Played by: </strong>Xochitl Gomez</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qxme001s3h6enu9gtfl2@published data-word-count=60><strong>The look: </strong>In the books, Dawn is Californian in the Sweet Valley High mold: she’s white, blonde, blue-eyed. In the Netflix series, our California girl is Mexican-American, and her vibe is less surfer, more skater. “She shops at vintage shops, wears tighter jeans and a camo bomber jacket,” Summers said. And: “She has the best sneaker collection in the world.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qxpb001t3h6eudgpwocw@published data-word-count=36><strong>The story: </strong>As one of two babysitters from outside Stoneybrook, Dawn gets to wear pieces that really set her apart from the other girls, who’ve all been shopping at the same mall basically all their lives.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcc5qxtq001u3h6ey0mzuhly@published data-word-count=82>“She’s probably the one that is the least similar to the books, or to any [depictions] in the past,” Summers said of Gomez’s version of Dawn. “She’s just drawn bigger, and that was intentional from production as well.” Her passion for the environment is definitely more pronounced; she’s engaged in activism in the show and wears plenty of “politically active slogan shirts,” like graphic tees that say SAVE THE OCEAN. “She brings that West Coast politics, the environmental politics, to the situation.”</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Styling The Baby-Sitters Club for a New Generation</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmny1tMRmmZqaqWLAqsDTnqmsZZOhwqN50q2wpZ1dmLy0wNSmoKefXZ67tbHRr6Cer16dwa64</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-baby-sitters-club-style-costuming-interview-html.html&text=Styling%20The%20Baby-Sitters%20Club%20for%20a%20New%20Generation&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-baby-sitters-club-style-costuming-interview-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-baby-sitters-club-style-costuming-interview-html.html&title=Styling%20The%20Baby-Sitters%20Club%20for%20a%20New%20Generation" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-baby-sitters-club-style-costuming-interview-html.html&title=Styling%20The%20Baby-Sitters%20Club%20for%20a%20New%20Generation" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-baby-sitters-club-style-costuming-interview-html.html&title=Styling%20The%20Baby-Sitters%20Club%20for%20a%20New%20Generation" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-baby-sitters-club-style-costuming-interview-html.html&description=Styling%20The%20Baby-Sitters%20Club%20for%20a%20New%20Generation" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./elf-makeup-true-crime-short-film-parody-8424264.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch e.l.f.'s True Crime Parody Documentary &amp;quot;Cosmetic Criminals&amp;quot;">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./strawberry-shortcake.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Strawberry Shortcake  Modern Honey">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
