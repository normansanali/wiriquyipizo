India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously. So, according to British law, Ms Murty is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income."</p><p id=ea-Y0pFV44Fz data-wc=58>Akshata then dissolved the non-dom status and explained in a statement: "It has become clear that many do not feel it is compatible with my husband’s role as chancellor.
