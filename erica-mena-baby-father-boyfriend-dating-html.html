Her books cover her childhood, love life, and experiences of single <a href=# rel=follow>motherhood</a>.</p><h2>Filed for Divorce from Husband Safaree Samuels</h2><p>The reality star <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">took</a> her wedding vows with rapper and television presenter&nbsp;Safaree Samuels on October 7, 2019. They had an intimate wedding&nbsp;at the Legacy Castle in New Jersey. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Their wedding was held after they got enaged&nbsp;on December 24, 2018, and more importantly, after <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">announcing</a>&nbsp;their first child together on October 1, 2019.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>On February 2, 2020, Mena and her then-husband eventually <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">welcomed</a> their daughter&nbsp;Safire Majesty Samuels. Just over a year after that [on May 4, 2021], the 33-year-old model <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> that she and&nbsp;Samuels&nbsp;were expecting their second child together.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>But the announcement was soon followed up by another confirmation that Mena filed for divorce from the rapper&nbsp;in Georgia's Fayette County Superior Court&nbsp;on May 21. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>According to court documents obtained by Page Six, Mena <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> that her marriage to Samuel was "irretrievably broken" with "no hope of reconciliation."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She reportedly asked for&nbsp;joint legal custody and final decision-making authority, requesting physical custody of their first child&nbsp;on a temporary and permanent basis, "with the parties having parenting time as determined in the minor children's best interests."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>As per TMZ's reports, Mena has also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">asked</a> Samuels to pay her legal fees, child support, and for the sole use of their home in Georgia. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-629 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Shares a Son with Her Former Partner Raul Conde</h2><p>Mena's first known boyfriend, rapper Raul Conde, ended up becoming her first baby’s father. She was&nbsp;18 years old when she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">gave</a> birth to their son&nbsp;King Conde on March 1, 2007.</p><p>But Conde turned out to be a bad influence as both a boyfriend and a baby father. Due to that, she <a href=# rel=follow>broke up</a> with him and decided to raise the baby all by herself.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Relating to her own experience of how a lousy father's presence affects a child, she was protective of her son and kept him away from her baby father. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In 2011,&nbsp;Mena and Conde&nbsp;were even <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">involved</a> in a fight, where&nbsp;Mena attacked the&nbsp;Terror Squad member&nbsp;outside of My Studio.

One of her relationships was with&nbsp;American rapper Shad Gregory Moss aka Bow Wow.</p><p>The couple first started dating when Mena was a guest host on 106 & Park in early 2014. For the next few months, they were seen together but did little to confirm that they were official entirely. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During the red carpet at the 2014 BET Hip-Hop Awards that fall, when an interviewer tried to confirm if she was dating the rapper, Mena <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a>&nbsp;her engagement instead.</p><p>By March 2015, Bow Wow shared photos of Mena in a wedding dress on the internet. But in September 2015, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">had</a> a heartbreaking miscarriage.&nbsp;</p><p>Following that, the two decided to split&nbsp;in late 2015. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-native_bottom"></span><p>Mena then found love in&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>NBA star</a> Kevin Durant’s adopted brother, Cliff Dixon. They <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">started</a> dating&nbsp;in early 2018. But four months later, they split on bad terms.</p><p>Sadly, Dixon passed away in March 2019 after&nbsp;being <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shot</a> in Atlanta. He was celebrating his birthday when a gunman opened fire in front of the club.</p><p>After that, Mena briefly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dated</a>&nbsp;music executive <a href=# rel=follow>Rich Dollaz</a>, but their relationship didn't last long. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Openly&nbsp;Bi</h2><p>The best-selling author came out of the closet as bi in 2015.</p><p>During an interview&nbsp;with Rolling Out magazine in January that year, Mena <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">opened</a> up about her orientation, explaining that she wasn’t a lesbian because she was attracted towards both genders.</p><p>"People have misconceptions about everyone I’ve dated. Last year, it’s like 'oh, all of sudden, she’s gay.' No, I’ve been [bi]," she stated. "In the past, I’ve been very open and affectionate towards females. It’s definitely no secret."</p><p>Speaking of dating females, Mena&nbsp;reportedly had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dated</a> her Love & Hip Hop: New York co-star&nbsp;Cyn Santana in 2014, as per Atlanta Black Star.</p><h2>Her Origin Story</h2><p>Born on November 8, 1987, Mena was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">raised</a> in Bronx, New York, by her parents and an elder sister. Her parents are of Puerto Rican and Dominican ethnicity.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-4 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Her father was a drug dealer who gave her family a hard time. Her mother was imprisoned because her father forced her to peddle drugs. It was during her time in prison she gave birth to Erica.</p><p>She was also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">abused</a> by her father until her mother was released from jail. By that time, Mena was already five years old.</p><p>Her elder sister ran the house in the absence of her mother and father. However, the model couldn’t save herself from the deep traumas, which profoundly impacted her behaviors. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5q%2Fqq%2FAZqSeppFir6Ku2GadmqyYmr9urs6ynauhlaOxbrDAraCnn16dwa64</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ferica-mena-baby-father-boyfriend-dating-html.html&text=Erica%20Mena%20Filed%20for%20Divorce%20from%20Safaree%20amid%20the%20Pregnancy%20%20Shes%20Dated%20Both%20Men%20and%20Women&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ferica-mena-baby-father-boyfriend-dating-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ferica-mena-baby-father-boyfriend-dating-html.html&title=Erica%20Mena%20Filed%20for%20Divorce%20from%20Safaree%20amid%20the%20Pregnancy%20%20Shes%20Dated%20Both%20Men%20and%20Women" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ferica-mena-baby-father-boyfriend-dating-html.html&title=Erica%20Mena%20Filed%20for%20Divorce%20from%20Safaree%20amid%20the%20Pregnancy%20%20Shes%20Dated%20Both%20Men%20and%20Women" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ferica-mena-baby-father-boyfriend-dating-html.html&title=Erica%20Mena%20Filed%20for%20Divorce%20from%20Safaree%20amid%20the%20Pregnancy%20%20Shes%20Dated%20Both%20Men%20and%20Women" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ferica-mena-baby-father-boyfriend-dating-html.html&description=Erica%20Mena%20Filed%20for%20Divorce%20from%20Safaree%20amid%20the%20Pregnancy%20%20Shes%20Dated%20Both%20Men%20and%20Women" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-old-is-donna-on-the-bold-and-the-beautiful.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How old is Donna on The Bold and the Beautiful?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./courtney-skippon-reflects-on-below-deck-experience-talks-bond-with-captain-lee-rosbach-and-kate-chastain.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Courtney Skippon reflects on Below Deck experience, talks bond with Captain Lee Rosbach and Kate Cha">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
