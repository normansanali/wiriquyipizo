However, when it came to accepting the Best Picture award, the pair offered producer Jonathan Wang the spotlight, and during his speech, Jonathan gave his wife Anni Sternisko a heartfelt shout-out.</span></p><p><span>But who is Jonathan’s wife? This Anni Sternisko Biography explores her life.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Anni Sternisko, Jonathan Wang Wife</b></h3><p><span>Anni Sternisko first went on a date with Jonathan Wang on October 19th, 2017, after ghosting him for over a week. “Anni finally texted me back saying she had 30 minutes free on Thursday the 19th to get a “quick drink” with me,” Jonathan recalled. But little did Anni know that Jonathan was in LA at the time.</span></p><p><span>“Regardless, I jumped at the opportunity and took her up on those 30 minutes,” Jonathan said. According to him, she was so “special” that he immediately booked a flight and flew to NYC the next morning just for the chance to get a few moments with her.</span></p><p><span>Fortunately, the 30-minute drink turned into a two-hour dinner and a nightcap at another bar. Five years later, it then turned into a perfect fairytale wedding in Würzburg, Bavaria, Germany.</span></p><p><span>The duo tied the know in July 2022 at Würzburg Residenz Hoffkeller. For the special day, Anni and Jonathan were accompanied by family and friends, and 100s of barrels of wine (literally).</span></p><p><span>Looking back, Jonathan said that 2022 was the “most glorious and dizzying” year of life he ever experienced. And it wasn’t just because he got married to the woman of his dreams and </span><i><span>Everything Everywhere All</span></i><span> turned out to be a hit, but also because Anni defended her Dissertation, became a Doctor, and ran a marathon.</span></p><p><span>That year, the lovebirds also moved out of their Silver Lake apartment of 12 years and renovated their new home in Mt. Washington.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, Jonathan couldn’t resist talking about his wife on the stage of the&nbsp; 95th Academy Awards. “To my brilliant and beautiful wife, Anni: If all this shiny stuff and tuxedos goes away, I would just love to do laundry and taxes with you for the rest of my life,”&nbsp; he said.</span></p><h3><b>Anni Sternisko Age</b></h3><p><span>Anni Sternisko was born before 1993.

You worked tirelessly, went above and beyond, and remained a kind and radiant human through the peaks and valleys. I love you more than words and am so damn proud of you!!”</span></p><p><span>He also said that Anni was the smartest, most tenacious human he’s ever met.</span></p><p><span>Coming back to Anni’s career, she’s also held jobs as Social Science Consultant at </span><i><span>Streitgut, NATO – The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Center for Public Interest Communications, Talk To Me</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Day One Project</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Before that, she worked as an Innovation Researcher at </span><i><span>WonderLab GbR</span></i><span> for 4 months, Human Resources Intern at </span><i><span>Kienbaum</span></i><span> for 2 months, Research Assistant at </span><i><span>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU)</span></i><span> München for 3 months, and Public Policy Intern at</span><i><span> Deutscher Bundestag</span></i><span> for a month.</span></p><p><span>Besides her doctorate, Anni also got her MPhil and MA in Psychology from </span><i><span>New York University</span></i><span> in 2020 and 2019 respectively.
