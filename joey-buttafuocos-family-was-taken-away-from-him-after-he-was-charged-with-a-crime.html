What’s he doing?&nbsp;Joey Buttafuoco is noted for his 1990s shenanigans, including his liaison with Amy Fisher. Convicted criminal Amy shot his then-wife Mary Jo Buttafuoco.&nbsp;Joey Buttafuoco discusses his background, including his ex-face-shooting, and wife’s on True Crime Daily (Published on 29 September 2015) Joey, a vehicle repair business proprietor, obtains three movie credits after his conviction and service. Joey Buttafuoco was sentenced to two months in August 2015 for unlawful ammunition possession.</p><h2>After criminal charges, Joey Buttafuoco lost his family</h2><p>Joseph A. Buttafuoco, born on March 11, 1956, rose to fame after an event in 1992 that flipped his life upside down. Amy Fisher, Joey’s then-17-year-old lover, went to his home in May 1992 with a loaded.25 caliber semiautomatic handgun to confront his wife, Mary Jo Buttafuoco.&nbsp;Amy approached Mary and then shot her in the face. His wife Mary was left deaf in one ear and with a partially paralyzed face. The inquiry into the incident yielded a slew of contradictory statements, which gained extensive publicity in both tabloids and mainstream media.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Joey-Buttafuoco-2.jpg alt="Joey Buttafuoco" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Joey’s connection with Amy was revealed after Amy’s assault conviction. Amy accused Joey of inciting her to kill his wife, Mary, and even got her a weapon.&nbsp;As further details about Joey’s transgressions emerged, he was charged with 19 charges of statutory rape, endangering the welfare of a minor, and sodomy. He first pled not guilty but then acknowledged to having a sexual connection with Amy despite the fact that she was just 16 years old.</p><p>The 62-year-old was sentenced to six months in jail and was freed after serving four months. On 3 February 2003, Mary Jo filed divorce papers when they went to California after Joey’s release from jail and he had to separate from his family, including his son and daughter.</p><h2>Joey Buttafuoco is attempting to live a normal life with his new wife, Evanka.</h2><p>Joey has a new life with his new wife, Evanka, whom he married in 2005. He met his wife when she was working as a repo lady via his firm. She said that she was hesitant to approach him at first, but she remained with him after hearing his tale.</p><p>I listened to the narrative and observed the tragedy, the sorrow, and the fact that he didn’t appear to know which way to go. (as said by-Evanka)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Joey-Buttafuoco-3.jpg alt="Joey Buttafuoco" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Evanka filed for divorce in May 2007, when Joey and Amy met over dinner and attempted to see a reality program about their life. However, she eventually dropped the petition in June 2007 and the couple has been together ever since.&nbsp;Joey Buttafuoco and his wife, Evanka, pose backstage at the FilmOn ‘Celebrity Fight Night’ at Avalon in Hollywood, California. (Image courtesy of gettyimages.com | 5 November 2011)</p><p>Joey may still be haunted by visions from his past, but his wife has taught him to live his life “through the windshield, not the rearview mirror.” His son, Paul, has changed his last name and severed relations with him, while his daughter, Jessica, attempts to maintain contact with him. Joey is now attempting to live a regular life as a freelance hot rod builder with a net worth of $20 thousand. He hasn’t mentioned creating a family with his wife, but if he does, he should be prepared to devote every ounce of his might to provide them with regular lives, something his children with Mary did not have.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Amy Fisher</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Joey Buttafuoco</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihqJ2pYq%2B2wNOana6nk6TAbrLApqClsV2srrR505qinqZdlsSixYyfqailXZ22rnnAn6ueql2dsm7DwKxknKCRp7SmsIywoK2gXZZ6pL7Ippxo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjoey-buttafuocos-family-was-taken-away-from-him-after-he-was-charged-with-a-crime.html&text=Joey%20Buttafuocos%20Family%20Was%20Taken%20Away%20From%20Him%20After%20He%20Was%20Charged%20With%20A%20Crime&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoey-buttafuocos-family-was-taken-away-from-him-after-he-was-charged-with-a-crime.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoey-buttafuocos-family-was-taken-away-from-him-after-he-was-charged-with-a-crime.html&title=Joey%20Buttafuocos%20Family%20Was%20Taken%20Away%20From%20Him%20After%20He%20Was%20Charged%20With%20A%20Crime" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjoey-buttafuocos-family-was-taken-away-from-him-after-he-was-charged-with-a-crime.html&title=Joey%20Buttafuocos%20Family%20Was%20Taken%20Away%20From%20Him%20After%20He%20Was%20Charged%20With%20A%20Crime" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjoey-buttafuocos-family-was-taken-away-from-him-after-he-was-charged-with-a-crime.html&title=Joey%20Buttafuocos%20Family%20Was%20Taken%20Away%20From%20Him%20After%20He%20Was%20Charged%20With%20A%20Crime" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoey-buttafuocos-family-was-taken-away-from-him-after-he-was-charged-with-a-crime.html&description=Joey%20Buttafuocos%20Family%20Was%20Taken%20Away%20From%20Him%20After%20He%20Was%20Charged%20With%20A%20Crime" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./josh-okogie-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-323601-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Josh Okogie Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jessica-simpsons-wows-with-three-killer-looks.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jessica Simpson is flawless in her latest modelling shots">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
