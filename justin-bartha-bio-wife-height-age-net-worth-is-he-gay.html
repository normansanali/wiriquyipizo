Hangover</span><span>&nbsp;Trilogy.</span></p><p><span>Bartha has recorded several credits on the small screen, including the sitcom&nbsp;</span><i><span>Teacher</span></i><span>&nbsp;and the comedy series&nbsp;</span><i><span>The New Normal</span></i><span>&nbsp;both on NBC.&nbsp;In 2017, the talented actor was cast in the role of Colin Morrello in the web series&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Good Fight</span></i><span></span></p><h2><strong><span>Justin Bartha biography, dude</span></strong></h2><p><span>Justin Lee Bartha was born on July 21, 1978 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.&nbsp;His parents are Stephen, a real estate developer, and Betty, a school teacher.&nbsp;He has one sibling, an older brother named Jeffrey.&nbsp;The family moved to West Bloomfield, Michigan when he was eight and he attended West Bloomfield High School there.&nbsp;He graduated from high school in 1966, after which he moved to New York City.&nbsp;For college, he attended New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, where he majored in film and drama.</span></p><p><span>Justin Bartha credited his acting debut as an uncredited extra in the drama film&nbsp;</span><i><span>54</span></i><span>&nbsp;(1998).&nbsp;He also took some time away from acting to play some behind-the-scenes roles afterwards.&nbsp;He worked as a production assistant on the 1999 film&nbsp;</span><i><span>Analyze the</span></i><span>&nbsp;Afterward, wrote, produced and directed the short film&nbsp;</span><i><span>High and Low</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2003).&nbsp;He wrote, produced and starred in an MTV pilot&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Dustin and Justin Show.</span></i></p><p><span>Bartha returned to screens with roles in the short&nbsp;</span><i><span>Carnival Sun</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2002) as well as the star-studded romantic comedy&nbsp;</span><i><span>Gigli</span></i><i>&nbsp;</i><span>(2003), opposite Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez.&nbsp;In 2004, he appeared as Riley Poole in the action-adventure film&nbsp;</span><i><span>National Treasure</span></i><span>&nbsp;which was a box office hit.&nbsp;The talented actor enjoyed further box office success with roles in&nbsp;</span><i><span>Mistakes Starting</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2006) and&nbsp;</span><i><span>National Treasure: Book of Secrets</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2007), a sequel to&nbsp;</span><i><span>National Treasure</span></i><span></span></p><p><span>The talented movie star struck gold again when he starred in the comedy film&nbsp;</span><i><span class=vcard><span class=fn><span>The Hangover</span></span></span></i><span>&nbsp;(2009) with Doug Billings.&nbsp;He also starred in the romantic comedy&nbsp;</span><span>The Rebound</span><span>&nbsp;(2009) opposite

II</span><span>&nbsp;(2011) and&nbsp;</span><i><span class=vcard><span class=fn><span>The Hangover Part III</span></span></span></i><span>&nbsp;(2013) were both very successful.&nbsp;After the success of the&nbsp;</span><span>Hangover</span><span>&nbsp;films at the box office, Bartha has also appeared in other films such as&nbsp;</span><i><span>CBGB</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2013),&nbsp;</span><i><span>White Girl</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2016) and&nbsp;</span><span>Sticky Notes</span><span>&nbsp;(2016).</span></p><p><span>Similarly, Justin Bartha’s television credits are as impressive as his film credits.&nbsp;His minor film debut came in 2004 with a small role in the TV movie The&nbsp;</span><span>Strip Search</span><span>&nbsp;This was followed by starring roles in the short-lived sitcom&nbsp;</span><i><span>Teacher</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2006) and the mini

Colin Morrello in the political drama series&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Good Fight</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2017-Present).</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and
