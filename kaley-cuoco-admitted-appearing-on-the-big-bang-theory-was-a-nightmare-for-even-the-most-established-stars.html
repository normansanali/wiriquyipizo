Kaley Cuoco made quite the reveal pertaining to some of the most established stars. Speaking alongside Elizabeth Olsen with Variety,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cuoco revealed some A-list guests struggled on The Big Bang Theory</a>.</p><p>For Cuoco, the performance came naturally given her experience in front of live audiences. However, it was a different story for those that weren't used to it, especially for well-known film stars.</p><p>Cuoco revealed, "Obviously, my whole life is a sitcom," Kaley said. "Especially with Big Bang, ‘cos the cast was like (go go go go go), there was no gap."</p><p>"We’d have these guest stars come on, and some of them were wonderful dramatic actors or whatever, and they would feel so lost for a while.

He was initially underwhelmed by what was planned for him. However, according to showrunner Steve Holland, things changed for Shatner after he was introduced to Kaley Cuoco.</p><p>"I think what changed going into the final season is that he knows [series co-star] Kaley [Cuoco] from doing [Priceline] commercials together and they’re friendly," he said.

We thought, what if Billy is this socially awkward, sympathetic doctor who doesn’t quite know how to process Penny’s flirtations with him. We had that basic idea and went to Billy and his people ran it by them. Billy was on the phone, and he thought it was a really fun idea and was into it.

"I had a Bob Newhart record album as a kid that was my father's (and) I did stand-up before I came to ('Big Bang').
