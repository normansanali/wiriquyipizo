To television series lovers, Esai is also well-known for his portrayal of Lieutenant Tony Rodriguez in “NYPD Blue”.</p><p>Perhaps you didn’t know that Esia is a co-founder of the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts, with Jimmy Smits and Sonia Braga. To learn more interesting things about him, let us tell you the naked truth about this versatile actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thebiography.org///thebiography.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1186238704-scaled.jpeg><h2><span id=Early_life_family_and_education>Early life, family, and education</span></h2><p>Born Esai Manuel Morales Junior under the zodiac sign of Libra on 1 October 1962, which makes him aged 60 (as of 2022), he hails from Brooklyn, New York City USA, thus he holds American nationality. Esai comes from a family of Puerto Rican descent, and is the only child of Esai Morales Senior and Iris Margarita. His parents divorced when he was a toddler, so Esai spent most of his childhood with his mother.</p><p>Esai spoke only Spanish until the age of five, learning the English language after he began attending school.

What happened to him?</span></h2><p>When Esai left “Ozark,” many of his fans asked what happened since his character was one of the main antagonists in the show.

As mentioned, Esai continued acting in other popular series, and we have a piece of great news for his fans.</p><p>Esai will be back on the big screen, playing <a rel=nofollow href=#>the main antagonist</a> in the action movie “Mission: Impossible-Dead Reckoning Part One”, starring Tom Cruise, announced for2023, and in addition, he’s already cast to appear in the 2024 sequel of this movie.</p><h2><span id=Love_life_and_relationships>Love life and relationships</span></h2><p>Esai is quite secretive when it comes to his personal life, and although there have been various rumors concerning his love life, he hasn’t commented on them.</p><p>He is a married man, and his wife is Elvimar Silva, who is only known as the wife of this famous actor.
