And every year, it does. Not to mention, the event never fails to attract top talent year after year for its halftime show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the past, performers have included Beyonce, Chris Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, Janet Jackson, Katy Perry, Bruno Mars, and many others. And then, 2022's halftime performance was headlined by Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dog, Kendrick Lamar, and Eminem (who <a href=#>ended his set by, controversially, taking a knee</a>).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Some Of The Richest Super Bowl Halftime Headliners, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>At the same time, the Super Bowl has also had a long history of showcasing some of the most memorable ads in American history. For instance, who can forget <a href=#>that time when Timothée Chalamet transformed into Edward Scissorhands</a><strong> </strong>for a Cadillac ad in 2021?</p><p>Clearly, Super Bowl ads are something else. But do they really have to be so expensive?</p><h2 id=a-brief-history-of-super-bowl-ads>A Brief History Of Super Bowl Ads</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It may be hard to believe but the Super Bowl ad business has been going on for over 50 years today. The Super Bowl began taking ads when it held its first match back in 1967. At that time, both NBC and CBS were airing the game and these networks charged $75,000 and $85,000 for a 60-second spot respectively.</p><p>Though it turns out the network has plenty of cash (<a href=#>Dwayne Johnson likely made bank as the announcer</a> in 2022), it's clearly looking for more.</p><p>Meanwhile, it seems that the company that inspired everyone else to release the best possible ads is none other than Apple, which came out with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their 1984 ad</a> for Super Bowl 18. Since then, the Super Bowl has become more than just another ad space. Instead, it’s become synonymous with top brand recognition and bragging rights. As far as commercials go, it’s the place to be seen.</p><h2 id=how-costly-are-these-super-bowl-ads>How Costly Are These Super Bowl Ads?</h2><p>​​​​​​​</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s safe to say that Super Bowl ad rates have grown tremendously since 1967. In fact, by 1995, the cost had already exceeded $1 million. According to NBC, the rate for a 30-second spot had gone up to $4.25 million by 2015 and that figure has continued to increase year-on-year to $5.6 million in 2021.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Janet Jackson's Super Bowl Scandal Hurt Her Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>As evidenced by the number of companies (that includes Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Budweiser, Tide, and Hyundai to name a few) that have shelled out a lot of money for these commercials.</p><p>And while some of these companies decided to put a pause on Super Bowl spending in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems many have returned in 2022 and their ads are bigger (and costlier) than ever before.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=so-why-are-super-bowl-ads-so-expensive>So, Why Are Super Bowl Ads So Expensive?</h2><p>​​​​​​​</p><p>Super Bowl ad rates tend to be higher than other events because they can guarantee brands a lot of exposure even if their ads only air for 30 or 60 seconds. According to estimates, at least 91.63 million people tuned in to see the game between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Kansas City Chiefs in 2021.</p><p>With digital viewing factored in, it is believed that the viewership could have gone as high 102.1 million. That easily makes the Super Bowl one of the most-watched events of the year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the same time, these big-spending advertisers would also go on to benefit from further publicity after the game as the ads (and sometimes, its stars) continue to generate buzz. Hence, despite having to spend millions, brands like Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, and many more believe they’re still getting a good deal at the end of the day.</p><h2 id=one-a-lister-isn-rsquo-t-warming-up-to-pricey-super-bowl-ads-just-yet>One A-Lister Isn’t Warming Up To Pricey Super Bowl Ads Just Yet</h2><p>​​​​​​​</p><p>And while several companies may believe that spending millions on a Super Bowl ad is a no-brainer, actor and businessman Ryan Reynolds is thinking differently. The Daredevil star always been vocal about his feelings towards Super Bowl ads since becoming the owner of the budget cell provider.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Tide's Super Bowl Ad Was The Real Winner Of The Night</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, it is worth pointing out that Mint has joined the Super Bowl ad craze at least once. This was back in 2019 when the company decided to focus on chunky-style milk. As hilarious as Reynolds may be, however, the A-lister can’t take credit for it since Reynolds only took ownership of the company later that year.</p><p>Since then, the actor has been vocal about avoiding costs associated with advertising during the Super Bowl so that Mint can pass on more savings to its customers. In fact, for this year, the company released an ad entitled Upcycled where it literally flipped old footage from its November 2021 ad.</p><p>In addition, Mint also chose to air its ad in a much earlier pre-game slot to guarantee the company even more ad savings. “The pregame was a very conscious choice for us,” Mint Mobile CMO Aron North told Fierce Wireless. “We’re always actively looking for ways to cut down on our costs so that we can pass the savings on to our consumers.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, it is also worth pointing out that Reynolds did participate in this year’s Super Bowl ads, sort of. For starters, he appeared in the Netflix ad, which showcases his upcoming film, The Adam Project (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the cast also includes Jennifer Garner, Zoe Saldana</a>,<strong> </strong>and Mark Ruffalo<strong>)</strong>.</p><p>At the same time, the actor also confirmed that he voiced Grimace in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McDonald’s Can I Get Uhhhhhhhhhhhh ad</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>This Is Why Betty White Loved Being In The Snickers Super Bowl Commercial</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdlr%2BmedKup56qXZe8uLiMmpusZaOkeqbEz56lrKGmmnw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-are-super-bowl-ads-so-expensive.html&text=Why%20Are%20Super%20Bowl%20Ads%20So%20Expensive%20%28Whether%20They%20Feature%20Celebs%20Or%20Not%29%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-are-super-bowl-ads-so-expensive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-are-super-bowl-ads-so-expensive.html&title=Why%20Are%20Super%20Bowl%20Ads%20So%20Expensive%20%28Whether%20They%20Feature%20Celebs%20Or%20Not%29%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-are-super-bowl-ads-so-expensive.html&title=Why%20Are%20Super%20Bowl%20Ads%20So%20Expensive%20%28Whether%20They%20Feature%20Celebs%20Or%20Not%29%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-are-super-bowl-ads-so-expensive.html&title=Why%20Are%20Super%20Bowl%20Ads%20So%20Expensive%20%28Whether%20They%20Feature%20Celebs%20Or%20Not%29%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-are-super-bowl-ads-so-expensive.html&description=Why%20Are%20Super%20Bowl%20Ads%20So%20Expensive%20%28Whether%20They%20Feature%20Celebs%20Or%20Not%29%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./258187-the-pioneer-woman-star-ree-drummond-shar-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=" 'The Pioneer Woman' Star Ree Drummond Shares Cute Snap of Her Kids Posing Together on Easter">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-meatloaf-wife-deborah-gillespie-get-to-know-about-the-family-of-the-late-american-singer-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Meatloaf Wife Deborah Gillespie?
