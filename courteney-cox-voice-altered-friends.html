During the interview, Geist asked Cox questions about her time after Friends, and she felt about watching herself back. Cox gave a surprising answer, revealing there were certain episodes she struggled to watch back given that the show had sped up her voice. Cox claims she didn't even sound like her true self because of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cox revealed, "Except for the ones where they added an extra commercial. So they sped it up a bit, which I can really tell. I can tell with all the characters, especially myself. I sound like Minnie Mouse or Tinkerbell."</p><p>"When it's not sped up, like it," she added.</p><p>Cox added that it feels like she has smoked a lot of cigarettes since the show came to an end, but that's not the case - just what her actual voice sounds like when it's not sped up by the network.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/courteney-cox-s-controversial-friends-commercial-never-made-it-on-the-air-and-was-banned-by-nbc.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Courteney Cox Had A Sneaky Way Of Writing Her Lines Down On Friends That Nobody Knew About">Courteney Cox Had A Sneaky Way Of Writing Her Lines Down On Friends That Nobody Knew About</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Courteney Cox had a unique way of reading her lines on Friends and nobody was catching on.</p><p>Cox made a positive impression on fans during the interview, and that held true with another statement she made about interacting with supporters of her career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=in-the-same-interview-with-the-today-show-cox-was-praised-for-her-comments-on-making-time-for-fans>In The Same Interview With The Today Show, Cox Was Praised For Her Comments On Making Time For Fans</h2><p>Cox would also discuss her fame from the show, and what it would lead to. The actress revealed there were a lot of perks, which included being able to get into high-end restaurants at the last minute. In addition, Cox revealed she wasn't bothered by the attention that came with it from the fans.</p><p>"I would definitely sign an autograph. I don't care what I was doing. I feel like, what if no one cared. I want to be able to give back no matter what I looked like."</p><p>She continues, "I feel lucky."</p><p>Cox would also add that she wasn't bothered if a fan would resell her autograph, and would feel bad given that they likely wouldn't make much of a profit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar52506685-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans had nothing but praise for Cox following her interview comments with Today.</p><p>One fan wrote, "When I was like 14, my mom and I ran into her at a hotel eating breakfast. She didn't have a drop of makeup on, was STUNNING, just eating breakfast with her daughter and like annoying fans, we approached her. She was so nice, took a picture with us, so down to earth, so charming."</p><p>"Her attitude about signing autographs and taking pics is on point. Be happy that people care, give love back. Very nice to hear. I KNOW."</p><p>"I think being famous in the 90s was different from the idea of “famous” now. Less paparazzi, no social media, no streaming services, etc. She is right about being lucky, and I love that she said that. Good interview clip."</p><p>Props to Cox for her interview conduct, which came across as completely genuine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=courteney-cox-also-admitted-she-was-a-bad-memory-when-it-comes-to-remembering-friends>Courteney Cox Also Admitted She Was A Bad Memory When It Comes To Remembering Friends</h2><p>Fans won't be thrilled with this one, but according to Cox, she doesn't remember filming a lot of scenes from Friends. Even before the anniversary special, Cox felt like she needed to brush up on her knowledge of the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar51127816.jpg><p>"I should've watched all 10 seasons because when I did the reunion and was asked questions, I was like, 'I don't remember being there' ... "Yeah, I don't remember filming so many episodes," she laughed. "I see it on TV sometimes and I stop and go, 'Oh my God, I don't remember this at all.' But it's so funny," she added.</p><p>Cox added that her memory is very basic, and she doesn't remember much from her past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's really basic; I don't remember any trauma in my childhood, but I have, like, three memories.
