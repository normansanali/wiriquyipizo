But that doesn't mean it doesn't come with baggage. The infamous dating website for people seeking affairs was <strong>hacked in 2015 and is now the subject of a new Netflix docu-series, Ashley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal</strong>. The documentary explores how the unknown hackers breached the inner workings of the website and <strong>leaked the private information of over 30 million users</strong>. Yes, over 30 million people were signed up to Ashley Madison looking to cheat on their suppose in secret.

At the time, Josh had to put out a statement, not only addressing being unfaithful to his wife but also touching upon the heinous crime that landed him in prison:</p><p>"I have been the biggest hypocrite ever. While espousing faith and family values, I have secretly over the last several years been viewing p*rnography on the internet and this became a secret addiction and I became unfaithful to my wife.
