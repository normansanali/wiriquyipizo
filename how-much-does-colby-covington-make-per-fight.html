Covington's fighting prowess and ability to generate attention have made him a highly marketable athlete. As a result, he has gained a substantial following and has also secured lucrative sponsorship deals. But just how much does Colby Covington make per fight?</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Rise of Colby Covington</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Before diving into Covington's earnings, it is important to understand his background and rise to prominence in the UFC. Covington, born on February 22, 1988, in Clovis, California, began his MMA career in 2012. He initially fought in regional promotions before joining the UFC in 2014.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Covington quickly made a name for himself in the welterweight division, showcasing his wrestling prowess and relentless pressure on his opponents. His fighting style, combined with his brash personality and controversial statements, helped him gain attention both inside and outside the octagon.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>UFC Contracts and Fight Purses</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>In the UFC, fighters are typically contracted to multiple-fight deals. These contracts outline the terms and conditions of the fighter's involvement with the promotion, including the number of fights and the payment structure. The exact details of these contracts are often kept confidential, but some estimates can be made based on publicly available information.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Colby Covington signed a multi-fight contract with the UFC, which means he is contracted to compete in a certain number of fights within a specific timeframe. The terms of these contracts can vary depending on the fighter's popularity, performance, and negotiation skills.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Fighters in the UFC earn money through various sources, including fight purses, performance bonuses, and sponsorship deals. The fight purse is the guaranteed amount a fighter receives for participating in a bout. This amount varies based on several factors, such as the fighter's experience, rankings, and the significance of the fight.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Estimated Earnings and Sponsorships</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>While the exact amount Colby Covington earns per fight is not publicly disclosed, some estimates can be made based on his status as a high-profile fighter. It is widely believed that Covington's earnings have increased significantly as he climbed the ranks and gained more attention.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Apart from his fight purses, Covington also generates income through sponsorship deals. Sponsorships are an essential part of an MMA fighter's income and can vary depending on the fighter's marketability and popularity. As Covington gained notoriety for his controversial statements and persona, his marketability increased, leading to more lucrative sponsorship opportunities.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Pay-Per-View Bonuses</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Pay-per-view (PPV) bonuses are another significant source of income for UFC fighters. When a fighter competes in a PPV event, they receive a percentage of the revenue generated from the pay-per-view buys. The exact percentage varies, but it is usually negotiated as part of the fighter's contract.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Colby Covington has been involved in several high-profile PPV events, including his title fight against Kamaru Usman at UFC 245. This fight garnered significant attention and generated a substantial number of pay-per-view buys. As a result, Covington likely received a sizeable bonus on top of his fight purse.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Additional Income Streams</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>In addition to his MMA career, Covington has explored other avenues to generate income. He has ventured into the world of professional wrestling and appeared in events organized by the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). These appearances not only provide exposure but also open doors to potential financial opportunities outside the UFC.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Covington has also shown interest in pursuing a career in acting. While he has not yet made significant strides in this field, his growing popularity and ability to capture attention could potentially lead to roles in movies or television shows, further expanding his income potential.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Colby Covington's earnings per fight are not publicly disclosed, but it is safe to assume that he earns a substantial amount considering his status as a high-profile UFC fighter. With his combination of fighting skills, controversial persona, and marketability, Covington has positioned himself as a valuable asset to the promotion. His fight purses, sponsorship deals, and potential bonuses from PPV events contribute to his overall income. As he continues to compete at the highest level and gain more attention, it is likely that Covington's earnings will continue to rise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6hprBlnaqwqXnDqJysZZOkuaPFjJymr6GenMGwuoymmKSdXaWys3nFop6hrA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-does-colby-covington-make-per-fight.html&text=How%20much%20does%20Colby%20Covington%20make%20per%20fight%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-does-colby-covington-make-per-fight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-does-colby-covington-make-per-fight.html&title=How%20much%20does%20Colby%20Covington%20make%20per%20fight%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-much-does-colby-covington-make-per-fight.html&title=How%20much%20does%20Colby%20Covington%20make%20per%20fight%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-does-colby-covington-make-per-fight.html&title=How%20much%20does%20Colby%20Covington%20make%20per%20fight%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-does-colby-covington-make-per-fight.html&description=How%20much%20does%20Colby%20Covington%20make%20per%20fight%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-cancel-ncsa-membership.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to cancel ncsa membership">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./eve-chilton-weinstein-wiki-harvey-weinstein-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eve Chilton Weinstein Wiki (Harvey Weinsteins ex-wife) Age, Net worth, Bio, Kids, Height &amp;amp; Weight">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
