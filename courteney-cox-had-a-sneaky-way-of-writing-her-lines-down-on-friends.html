While working on the show, she had some trouble remembering her lines. However, <a href=#>Cox has said that she wasn't the worst cast member when it came to memorizing lines</a>.</p><p>Cox herself also opened up about how she had trouble remembering her own lines on the series. During an episode of The Graham Norton Show, Courteney Cox sat down to talk about how she hid her lines on-set, and how one cast member used this to play a prank on her.</p><p>Norton said, "One of the things that's come up in discussions about Friends over the years is, learning lines..." The Ace Ventura: Pet Detective actress responded, "Oh, yeah, it's kind of like theater," smiling back at the host. Norton then elaborated what he meant. "Yeah, but you're not that keen on learning lines."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cox quickly agreed with him, saying, "Oh yeah, you're right," earning laughter from the audience. "You get to do it again if you don't know your lines. But yes, I didn't always have an easy time remembering my lines on Friends."</p><p>"So you would... Not well, I suppose, cheat, is it cheating?" The host asked the Scream actress. She replied, "Kind of, yeah."</p><p>He then asked her about the sneaky on-set secret she used to help her remember the right thing to say when filming an episode, something not even her fellow cast members knew about!</p><h2 id=courteney-cox-put-her-lines-in-the-fruit-jar-of-the-kitchen-on-friends>Courteney Cox Put Her Lines In The Fruit Jar Of The Kitchen On Friends</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Monica-Geller-1.jpg><p>When Courteney Cox was starring as Monica Geller on Friends, she had a trick to help her remember her lines.

The Friends explained, "Well, ok, so the writers would sometimes give you new scripts, right on the spot, or right before, or sometimes I also didn't prepare as much as I should have."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Creators Of Friends Decided To Cut A Scene That Shows Joey Taking A Shot At Monica</a></span></p><p>Cox continued, "So, I would put my lines in the fruit bowl sometimes. Sometimes in the sink. Sometimes you'd just be sitting there, and you'd go to the sink and pretend to wash and look a couple pages in, yeah."</p><p>Although Cox was hiding her lines on-set and nobody knew, not even her fellow cast members, she was eventually caught by her co-star Matt LeBlanc, who played Joey Tribbiani on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matt-leblanc-played-a-prank-on-courteney-cox-when-she-tried-to-cheat-and-read-her-lines>Matt LeBlanc Played A Prank On Courteney Cox When She Tried To Cheat And Read Her Lines</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/A-scene-from-Friends-featuring-David-Schwimmer-Courteney-Cox-Matthew-Perry-Lisa-Kudrow-Matt-LeBlanc-and-Jennifer-Aniston-via-FilmAffinity.jpg><p><a href=#>It seems the cast of Friends truly enjoyed working together</a> on the beloved sitcom, and <a href=#>tried to soften the blow for each other when they filmed the final episode</a>. Before that, they seemed to have fun on the set together.</p><p>For example, <a href=#>Matt LeBlanc would prank one of his co-stars, David Schwimmer, backstage</a>. And when LeBlanc noticed the sneaky way Cox had been hiding lines on-set, he couldn't help but play a prank on her too.</p><p>Cox revealed to Graham Norton what happened during their interview. "One time in particular I had something large to say. It was like a... I would call it like a paragraph, and (she laughs) now I remember, like a two-incher." After the actress paused for a moment, she then commented on what she had just said, commenting, "That sounds weird," getting plenty of laughs from the audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Anyway, Matt LeBlanc, didn't tell me obviously, it was a prank on me, and I didn't know it at all! And he took the piece of paper that I had in the fruit bowl, and I was like, getting an apple..." Cox then imitated herself feeling around a fruit bowl for a piece of paper that was no longer there.</p><p>"And I just winged it? Whatever the word is, I did, and I think it worked out. But it was not okay"</p><p>Norton asked if LeBlanc ever told her what he'd done, "But did he confess?" Cox responded that he eventually owned up to the prank, years later. "Yeah, on the Friends reunion, that's where I learned it."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Food On Friends Was Very Much Real And Once Caused David Schwimmer To Gag Mid-Scene</a></span></p><p>Norton commented, "Not until then? That's a long time to keep that secret." It certainly is! Surprisingly Cox had no idea LeBlanc had played a prank on her by hiding her lines, when he finally confessed during the Friends reunion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering what we now know about some of the places Courteney Cox hid her lines, when re-watching Friends, play extra-close attention when she's at the sink, or near any fruit!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaqK2iqbKvsdhmmqiwXZ2upXnAZqqnnZGgxm7DwLJkqJ5drL%2BqwMinnmaglad6rbXNnqpmnJ%2Bsu267zWadq6GVo7G0ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcourteney-cox-had-a-sneaky-way-of-writing-her-lines-down-on-friends.html&text=Courteney%20Cox%20Had%20A%20Sneaky%20Way%20Of%20Writing%20Her%20Lines%20Down%20On%20Friends%20That%20Nobody%20Knew%20About&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcourteney-cox-had-a-sneaky-way-of-writing-her-lines-down-on-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcourteney-cox-had-a-sneaky-way-of-writing-her-lines-down-on-friends.html&title=Courteney%20Cox%20Had%20A%20Sneaky%20Way%20Of%20Writing%20Her%20Lines%20Down%20On%20Friends%20That%20Nobody%20Knew%20About" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcourteney-cox-had-a-sneaky-way-of-writing-her-lines-down-on-friends.html&title=Courteney%20Cox%20Had%20A%20Sneaky%20Way%20Of%20Writing%20Her%20Lines%20Down%20On%20Friends%20That%20Nobody%20Knew%20About" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcourteney-cox-had-a-sneaky-way-of-writing-her-lines-down-on-friends.html&title=Courteney%20Cox%20Had%20A%20Sneaky%20Way%20Of%20Writing%20Her%20Lines%20Down%20On%20Friends%20That%20Nobody%20Knew%20About" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcourteney-cox-had-a-sneaky-way-of-writing-her-lines-down-on-friends.html&description=Courteney%20Cox%20Had%20A%20Sneaky%20Way%20Of%20Writing%20Her%20Lines%20Down%20On%20Friends%20That%20Nobody%20Knew%20About" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dick-york-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dick York Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./claudia-ramirez-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Claudia Ramirez | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
