Today's list is about reality television star Paris Hilton who has certainly had her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fair share of boyfriends over the years</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About Paris Hilton’s New Documentary</a></span></p><p>With her new documentary This Is Paris out, the 2000c icon is as relevant as ever — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even model Kendall Jenner couldn't agree more</a>. Currently, Paris Hilton is dating Carter Reum and since he isn't necessarily a celeb himself keep on scrolling to find out more about him!</p><h2 id=carter-is-an-established-entrepreneur><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Carter&nbsp;Is An Established Entrepreneur</span></h2><p>Kicking the list off is the fact that Carter Reum is an established entrepreneur. Together with his brother Courtney Reum, Carter co-founded and built VEEV Spirits — an all-natural vodka brand that the brothers eventually sold to have more time to focus on their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">investment company M13</a>. Since then, with M13 they have invested in successful companies such as Snapchat, Pinterest, and Lyft.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-a-published-author><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>And A Published Author</span></h2><p>While Paris Hilton has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">done plenty of things since The Simple Life</a>, Carter also didn't stick to just one project. Together with his brother, in 2018 Carter released an advice book for entrepreneurs called Shortcut Your Startup: Speed Up Success with Unconventional Advice from the Trenches. The book quickly became a success and today Paris' boyfriend can add 'author' to his resume.</p><h2 id=he-is-also-contributing-for-huffington-post-and-inc-magazine><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Is Also Contributing For&nbsp;Huffington Post&nbsp;And Inc.

Considering that the two have their birthdays so close together (and close to Valentine's day) they could have a joint birthday party. Above, the couple can be seen traveling together and it's evident that they couldn't keep their hands off each other.</p><h2 id=the-two-met-through-friends-and-they-ve-known-each-other-for-15-years><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Two Met Through Friends And They've Known Each Other For 15 Years</span></h2><p>Paris Hilton is known for having <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">plenty of friends</a>, and it seems as if some of those have introduced her to Carter.

Many fans may not know that the former The Simple Life star has actually been dating Carter Reum <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">since April 2019</a> and considering that they are still together a year and a half later they must be quite serious.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-made-their-debut-at-the-golden-globes-awards><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They Made Their Debut At The Golden Globes Awards</span></h2><p>As previously mentioned, Paris and Carter have been together since April 2019 however the couple only made their official debut earlier this year.
