Her extraordinary talent on the court was evident as she was named the state’s girls basketball player of the year in 2000.</p><p>This early recognition paved the way for her entrance into collegiate basketball, as she committed to play for the University of Tennessee with the Tennessee Volunteers women’s basketball team.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Tasha Butts’ Net Worth?</h2><p>At the time of her passing, Tasha Butts possessed a substantial net worth, with estimates placing it at no less than $1 million. Her financial success was a testament to her diverse and accomplished career, which spanned her roles as a professional basketball player and a seasoned coach, as well as her contributions to various NCAA programs.</p><p>Tasha Butts’ journey in basketball, from her standout high school career to her brief but impactful stint in the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA), undoubtedly contributed to her financial well-being. Her dedication and passion for the sport, coupled with her strong work ethic, allowed her to secure contracts and make valuable connections within the industry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/rwBDBOnbD-4/hqdefault.jpg><p>In 2004, the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) came calling, selecting Tasha Butts as the 20th overall pick in the draft. She made her professional debut with the Minnesota Lynx during the 2004 WNBA season, showcasing her skills at the highest level of women’s basketball. Although her time with the Lynx was relatively short-lived, she continued her journey in the WNBA, securing various contracts with different teams over the next four years.</p><p>However, her heart always seemed to pull her back to the University of Tennessee. In 2005, she returned to her alma mater, this time as a graduate assistant, marking her transition from player to mentor. Her expertise and passion for the game became increasingly evident as she embarked on a career in coaching.</p><p>Butts’ coaching journey took her to several NCAA schools over the span of 17 seasons. She initially served as an assistant coach at Duquesne University before making the leap to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Her valuable contributions as a coach were further highlighted during her tenure from 2011 to 2019 as an assistant coach at Louisiana State University, and subsequently, from 2019 to 2023 when she dedicated her talents to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets women’s basketball team.</p><p>In April 2023, Tasha Butts was appointed as the head coach of the Georgetown Hoyas women’s basketball team, marking a significant milestone in her career. However, this triumphant moment was bittersweet, as she tragically succumbed to breast cancer before she could lead her team in their first game under her leadership.</p><p>Tasha Butts’ legacy in the world of basketball is one of unwavering dedication, passion, and a commitment to the sport that spanned both her playing days and her coaching career. Her impact on and off the court will be remembered by fans, players, and fellow coaches alike, making her a true inspiration in the basketball community.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfmqxdnsBuwMCsn5plkqrBtb%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-tasha-butts-net-worth.html&text=What%20is%20Tasha%20Butts%20Net%20Worth%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-tasha-butts-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-tasha-butts-net-worth.html&title=What%20is%20Tasha%20Butts%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-tasha-butts-net-worth.html&title=What%20is%20Tasha%20Butts%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-tasha-butts-net-worth.html&title=What%20is%20Tasha%20Butts%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-tasha-butts-net-worth.html&description=What%20is%20Tasha%20Butts%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-yordenis-ugas-wife-is-the-boxer-married.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Yordenis Ugs Wife?
