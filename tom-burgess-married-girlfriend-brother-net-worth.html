They tied the knot and exchanged wedding vows in a stunning star-studded ceremony in a waterfront park in Sydney's Watsons Bay on Friday.</span></p><p><span>Tom's beautiful bride, Tahlia wore a gorgeous long white veil and carried a bouquet of white orchids and roses. She looked elegant with her frock sleeveless and featured a cowl-neck design and small train and completed her look with natural makeup of deep pink lip. Tahlia wore her brunette locks up and off her face in an elegant bun.</span></p><p><span>The couple finally got married after their wedding was canceled last year due to the pandemic. They had announced their engagement on New Year's Eve in 2019 and announced the postponement of their original wedding plans back in July following two years of intricate planning. At the time, she wrote on Instagram, <strong>"After almost two years of planning. Tom and I had to make the sad decision to postpone and move our wedding venue completely."</strong></span></p><p><span>They had to postpone their wedding as Tom contracted Covid-19 during a holiday to Byron Bay. On 11 December, Tahlia had again shared marking their planned wedding day and wrote, <strong>"Happy 'should have been' wedding day'. We should have been saying our vows right now in front of our family and friends in Byron Bay and celebrating with one too many cocktails. Instead, we turned it into a family holiday, made some more memories, and soaked up the pre-wedding bliss that is still to come."</strong></span></p><p><span>Last week, some outlets confirmed their wedding and all the Burgess brothers including SAS Australia winner Sam will attend.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong><span>Tom Burgess Relationship With Wife Turned Girlfriend Tahlia Giumelli</span></strong></h2><p><span>Tom Burgess and his now-wife, Tahlia Giumelli, had announced their engagement on New Year's Eve 2019 after three years of dating. Tom's wife, Tahlia grew up in the iconic beachside suburb of Cronulla. She is a model and had entered the prestigious Girlfriend Model search when she was 17 years old. She became the finalist in New South Wales 2011 competition and was awarded a modeling contract with Chic Management. She has worked with companies like Boohoo and DASH and she is also the finalist for Miss Universe Australia in 2017. Furthermore, Tahlia was also the face of Rusty's global Autumn/Winter 2019 campaign and in Valentine's campaign for Bras N Things.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Tom and Tahlia share two children together named Sophie and Elodie. They welcomed Sophie in August 2019 and Elodie in November 2020. They also bought a four-bedroom home in Woolooware for $2.61 million. They renovated the home built in 2002 and shared some of the photos via Instagram.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net Worth Of Tom Burgess</span></strong></h2><p><span>Tom Burgess is famous as the twin of George and brother of South's icon Sam but he is also recognized for his talent and skills as a professional footballer playing for Rabbitohs. His <a href=# rel=noopener>salary</a> is $700,000 according to World Wide of Sports. He is also one of the toughest enforcers in the game and has been with South Sydney Rabbitohs for almost a decade. He has made 118 appearances for the Rabbitohs since joining the club in 2013.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But before Rabbitohs, he had registered four tries in 45 appearances for the Bradford Bulls between 2011 and 2012. He is also a twin brother of George Burgess who is set to return to the NRL next season with St George Illawarra and Tom has recently spoken about his twin brother's return with media saying how they both got tight hips and he managed to do yoga but George needed to go under the knife, so he needed time for recovery. He said,<strong> "I've been pretty lucky touch-wood through my career, but George has shown great strength to fight back now and he's had the operation. It wasn't an easy decision for him, it was quite an invasive operation."</strong></span></p><p><span>Tom also added how he was proud of George and looking forward to catching up with him when he gets back to Sydney and he even shared how he looks forward to the challenge of playing against his twin saying, <strong>"Never - we've obviously have had a lot of contact at training when we were together at Souths and stuff. I've never played against him properly, so it will be interesting."</strong></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunC%2Fz6ipratfqbyuecGuqaCdo6h6rq3Rq6CenF2ctrO4xaugnqaUYq%2Bzu9OhnKtlnprBbsPOq6uh</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftom-burgess-married-girlfriend-brother-net-worth.html&text=Tom%20Burgess%20Married%20Girlfriend%20Tahlia%20Giumelli%7c%20Insights%20About%20His%20Brother%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Contract&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftom-burgess-married-girlfriend-brother-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftom-burgess-married-girlfriend-brother-net-worth.html&title=Tom%20Burgess%20Married%20Girlfriend%20Tahlia%20Giumelli%7c%20Insights%20About%20His%20Brother%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Contract" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftom-burgess-married-girlfriend-brother-net-worth.html&title=Tom%20Burgess%20Married%20Girlfriend%20Tahlia%20Giumelli%7c%20Insights%20About%20His%20Brother%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Contract" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftom-burgess-married-girlfriend-brother-net-worth.html&title=Tom%20Burgess%20Married%20Girlfriend%20Tahlia%20Giumelli%7c%20Insights%20About%20His%20Brother%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Contract" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftom-burgess-married-girlfriend-brother-net-worth.html&description=Tom%20Burgess%20Married%20Girlfriend%20Tahlia%20Giumelli%7c%20Insights%20About%20His%20Brother%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Contract" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bebe-rexha-shares-what-its-like-to-smoke-weed-with-snoop-dogg-thats-like-a-lifetime-thing.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title>&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sebastian-moy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sebastian Moy">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
