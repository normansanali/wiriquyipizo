Is he in the NFL? His professional status hasn't stopped him from meeting women.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Now that <a href=#>Netflix</a>'s <a href=#>Too Hot to Handle</a> is back for Season 2, we're seeing attractive singles try their best to keep their hands off of each other. On this season, there are people with all kinds of jobs – some contestants are models, and one TikTok star who plays professional football has also made the cut.</p><p>Chase may be a newcomer to the show, but he says he's never had a problem meeting women. With good looks, a large social media presence, and a career as a pro athlete, Chase gives the women of the Too Hot to Handle cast many reasons to give him their attention. Keep reading for everything you need to know about him.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who's Chase on 'Too Hot to Handle?' Is he in the NFL?</h2><p>Chase DeMoor is a 24-year-old football player from Arizona. Although he's not in the NFL, he's played for teams like the Arizona Rattlers and the Houston Linemen, and credits his pro football career for his luck with women. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He told People</a> that he has a sex drive that's "100 out of 10" so it's not going to be a surprise that being on Too Hot to Handle will be a little rough for him.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>On top of everything else he has going for him, it certainly helps that Chase has a large following on social media. On TikTok alone, he's got a million followers. He typically shows off his football career and family on there, but his Instagram is where he keeps all his selfies.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chase's time on 'Too Hot to Handle' may be life-changing.</h2><p>Although episodes of Too Hot to Handle are still coming out, we've already seen a glimpse into Chase's journey on the show. Aside from a huge bug flying onto his forehead, we see that not being able to hook up means that he's paying attention to his emotions in a way he may never have prior to filming the show.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>In one of the trailers for the show, we see Chase talking about feeling things he's never felt before. "That really brought a lot of emotion that I didn't even know I had," he says in a conversation with a woman named Carly, a model from Canada. As of now, we have yet to see how their relationship – if they have one – will play out on the show.</p><p>If Chase is catching feelings for Carly, the show may not work out for him in the long run. Carly calls herself a "man-eater" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to People</a>, and on Too Hot to Handle, she's talked about loving to party and only seeking men to hang out with for a night. But who knows? The show still has a bunch of weekly episodes to put out, so we have a lot to look forward to.</p><p>You can watch Season 2 of Too Hot to Handle on Netflix now. New episodes come out weekly on Wednesday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWiv8Rmq6inXZ28tXnTqGShmZ6ZuaZ5zZ%2Bj</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchase-too-hot-to-handle-nfl.html&text=Chase%20from%20%27Too%20Hot%20to%20Handle%27%20May%20Trade%20in%20His%20Sex%20Drive%20for%20His%20Feelings&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchase-too-hot-to-handle-nfl.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchase-too-hot-to-handle-nfl.html&title=Chase%20from%20%27Too%20Hot%20to%20Handle%27%20May%20Trade%20in%20His%20Sex%20Drive%20for%20His%20Feelings" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchase-too-hot-to-handle-nfl.html&title=Chase%20from%20%27Too%20Hot%20to%20Handle%27%20May%20Trade%20in%20His%20Sex%20Drive%20for%20His%20Feelings" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchase-too-hot-to-handle-nfl.html&title=Chase%20from%20%27Too%20Hot%20to%20Handle%27%20May%20Trade%20in%20His%20Sex%20Drive%20for%20His%20Feelings" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchase-too-hot-to-handle-nfl.html&description=Chase%20from%20%27Too%20Hot%20to%20Handle%27%20May%20Trade%20in%20His%20Sex%20Drive%20for%20His%20Feelings" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./eslabon-armado-pedro-navaja.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eslabon Armado Pedro Navaja Wiki, Bio, Wife, Height, Dead or Alive">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./harry-potter-movies-how-to-stream-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Are the Harry Potter Movies on HBO Max or Peacock Right Now?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
