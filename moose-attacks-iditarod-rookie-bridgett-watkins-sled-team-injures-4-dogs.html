It starts March 5 in Anchorage.</p><p>“As he charged me I emptied my gun into him and he never stopped,” she wrote on Facebook. “I ran for my life and prayed I was fast enough to not be killed in that moment. He trampled the team and then turned for us.”</p><p>Watkins said she and a friend who was trailing her on a snowmobile took refuge next to the snowmobile.</p><p>The moose stopped its charge toward them about 2 feet (0.6 meters) from the snowmobile and she managed to cut free six dogs that were tied to the machine.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>“This has been the most horrific past 24 hours of my life.”</p>Bridgett Watkins</figure><p>But the moose went back to her sled and began stomping the dogs that were still tethered to it — standing over the dogs and trampling them repeatedly for over an hour.</p><p>“I have never felt so helpless in my life,” Watkins wrote. “He would not leave us alone and he even stood over top of the team refusing to retreat.”</p><p>She called friends and the moose was shot and killed after one arrived with a rifle.</p><p>Alaska State Troopers had been preparing a helicopter to respond but stopped doing so after they were told the moose was dead, agency spokesperson Tim DeSpain said in an email.</p><p>Her four injured dogs were taken to a veterinarian in the nearby community of North Pole and are recovering, Watkins posted.</p><p>Watkins, a native of Arkansas who moved to Alaska when she was 5, is no stranger to mushing or its dangers. Her father and step-mother are well-known mushers Allen Moore and Aliy Zirkle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/AP22040093876472.jpg><p>In the 2016 Iditarod, Zirkle and four-time winner Jeff King were attacked by a man on a snowmobile near the community of Nulato. One dog on King’s team was killed and two others were injured.</p><p>Another famous tale of a musher’s run-in with an angry moose happened in the 1985 Iditarod — when the late Susan Butcher came across one while she was leading the race.</p><p>She used her ax and a parka to fight off the moose, but it killed two of her dogs and injured 13 others. Another musher came along and killed the moose.</p><p>She had to withdraw from the race, but later won four Iditarod races. Butcher died in 2006 from leukemia at age 51.</p><p>“It is never a musher’s intention to go out and kill an animal,” Watkins told the AP.</p><p>She said no musher would ever travel with a rifle or a large caliber gun, instead preferring to scare off animals with a flare gun. And with all the jostling of the sled, the larger guns could easily go off.</p><p>“People have a lot of negative comments about what I should or should not have been doing but they’re not the people on the back of that sled,” she said.</p><p>“It’s not that I wasn’t prepared. I wasn’t prepared to kill a moose, that’s correct,” Watkins said. “It’s not my intention to go around in February and hunt and kill an animal. This is like worst-case scenario defending my life.”</p><p>She did carry a .380 caliber gun because there are few people where she trains, and she keeps it to to deter or scare off animals. She has since upgraded to a larger caliber firearm after it didn’t stop the moose.</p><p>“That would be asinine to go back out there on the same trail, the same place, and not have a gun where I can’t truly put down an animal if I have to,” she said.</p><p>The experience has rattled her, but it’s really no different than what other people face, she said.</p><p>“I’m just trying to face those fears every day because they’re there. It’s not that I’m not scared and I’m not terrified and that I don’t nearly have a panic attack when I’m on the sled and I think I see a moose in front of me,” she said.</p><p>“It’s not that those things aren’t occurring … people have these situations in their life all the time. They’re just different obstacles that they have to overcome, and this is mine, and this is my story, and I just hope that I can be inspiring.”</p><p>Meat from the moose that attacked her dogs was donated to charity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7j2tmaXFforywv8RmmK2skZi4tHnInaCtmaKksW6%2Bzqiiop1dl7%2BqsMaeq61lp5bBrLXNrGSspJWZerWxwKZkoqaaqr%2Bmv4xtZJ2nl6h8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmoose-attacks-iditarod-rookie-bridgett-watkins-sled-team-injures-4-dogs.html&text=Moose%20attacks%20Iditarod%20rookie%20Bridgett%20Watkins%20sled%20team%2c%20injures%204%20dogs&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmoose-attacks-iditarod-rookie-bridgett-watkins-sled-team-injures-4-dogs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmoose-attacks-iditarod-rookie-bridgett-watkins-sled-team-injures-4-dogs.html&title=Moose%20attacks%20Iditarod%20rookie%20Bridgett%20Watkins%20sled%20team%2c%20injures%204%20dogs" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmoose-attacks-iditarod-rookie-bridgett-watkins-sled-team-injures-4-dogs.html&title=Moose%20attacks%20Iditarod%20rookie%20Bridgett%20Watkins%20sled%20team%2c%20injures%204%20dogs" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmoose-attacks-iditarod-rookie-bridgett-watkins-sled-team-injures-4-dogs.html&title=Moose%20attacks%20Iditarod%20rookie%20Bridgett%20Watkins%20sled%20team%2c%20injures%204%20dogs" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmoose-attacks-iditarod-rookie-bridgett-watkins-sled-team-injures-4-dogs.html&description=Moose%20attacks%20Iditarod%20rookie%20Bridgett%20Watkins%20sled%20team%2c%20injures%204%20dogs" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./olivia-culpo-gushes-over-fiance-christian-mccaffrey-after-49ers-nfc-win.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Olivia Culpo Gushes Over Fiance Christian McCaffrey After 49ers NFC Win">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./marissa-callahan-net-worth-167987.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Marissa Callahan Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
