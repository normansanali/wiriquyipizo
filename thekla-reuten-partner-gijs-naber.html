She studied acting at the Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten in Amsterdam. During her last year of school, she played leading roles in Dutch movies and plays. <a href=# rel=noopener>Early in her career</a>, she won the “Shooting Star Award” at the Berlin Film Festival for her role as Lotte in the film Twin Sisters, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. After that, she played parts in movies like “In Bruges” with Colin Farrell, “Hotel Lux” with “Bully” Herbig, “The American” with George Clooney, and “Waffenstillstand,” a political thriller (“Ceasefire”).

Early this year, she stayed in St. Petersburg for two months to film In Transit with rising German <a href=# rel=noopener>star Daniel</a> Bruhl, legendary actor John Malkovich, and Hollywood regular Thomas Kretschmann. In British director Tom Roberts’s first movie, she plays Elena, a Russian woman who is caught up in the return of female prisoners and refugees at the end of <a href=# rel=noopener>World War</a> II.</p><p>Before that, she was in Lithuania to film the female lead role in Brett Leonard’s Highlander: The Source with <a href=# rel=noopener>British actor</a> Adrian Paul (Lawnmower Man, Virtuosity).

After twenty years, the Highlander series is still considered one of the most successful independent film and TV franchises. It <a href=# rel=noopener>comes back</a> here in an exciting story about love, family, and the quest.</p><p>Alex van Warmerdam, a well-known Dutch director, hired Thekla to be in his <a href=# rel=noopener>upcoming film</a> Ober at the end of 2005. (Waiter). This is the <a href=# rel=noopener>latest movie</a> project from the famous Van Warmerdam brothers from Holland. Alex (Grimm, The Northerners) is the director and screenwriter, while Marc is the producer and Vincent is the composer. In the comedy about a 50-year-old waiter named Edgar who <a href=# rel=noopener>works in a restaurant that has seen better days</a>, Thekla plays Suzie. Edgar gets bored with his life and realizes there must be more to it. He wants a girlfriend, new neighbors, and to be happy.</p><p>People at festivals all over the world have also seen CO/MA, an experimental film about acting by British <a href=# rel=noopener>director Mike</a> Figgis, in which Thekla pushes herself even further in front of the camera.</p><p>Last summer, critics praised Thekla’s lead role in Lorca’s Blood Wedding, which ran in London to sold-out crowds and starred Mexican star Gael Garcia Bernal. Thekla’s dramatic lead role as Gael’s forbidden love interest in the Rufus Norris production was praised by all critics as a triumph.</p><p>This award gave Thekla even more credibility with international audiences. It added to the European <a href=# rel=noopener>film awards she had already won and to the title “Dutch Shooting Star” that the Berlin International Film Festival</a> gave her in 2004.</p><p>The Oscar-nominated movie Twin Sisters (De Tweeling) (2003), which Thekla starred in and was nominated for, was released on DVD in the US and UK over the summer.

Thekla was cast as one of the sisters, Lotte, and was praised for her emotional and <a href=# rel=noopener>heartfelt performance</a> as a young woman who was physically and emotionally separated from her twin by the wounds of war in Europe and the horrors of the Nazis.</p><p>This was the <a href=# rel=noopener>second time</a> that the Academy had chosen a work by Thekla. Everybody’s Famous, which came out in 2000, had been nominated for Best Foreign Film.</p><p>Since her mother is Italian and she speaks five European languages (Dutch, English, Italian, German, and French), she was a natural choice for the Italian film Una Bellezza Che Non Lascia Scampo (2000), which built on the success of Everybody’s Famous to become a <a href=# rel=noopener>hit across</a> Europe. Little Crumb, the movie she made in 1999, had won more than ten awards at <a href=# rel=noopener>international film festivals</a> by the time it was shot.</p><p>After graduating from Amsterdam’s Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1997, Thekla was quickly noticed by stage and <a href=# rel=noopener>film directors</a>, who cast her in major productions, starting with the popular Dutch TV show Wij Alexander.</p><p>Thekla Reuten is now <a href=# rel=noopener>well known</a> as one of the best actresses in Europe.
