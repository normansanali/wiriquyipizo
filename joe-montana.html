Famous San Francisco 49ers quarterback who was the team’s leader in the four Super Bowl victories after winning the nation-wide championship with Notre Dame.&nbsp;The team was awarded the Super Bowl MVP three times and chosen as a participant in the Pro Bowl eight times, and selected as a member of the 1980s All-Decade Team.</p><p>The successor to him,&nbsp;His successor, <a href=#>Steve Young</a>, served as his back-up quarterback from 1987-1990.&nbsp;was his backup quarterback between 1987 and 1990.</p><p>Joseph Clifford Montana Jr. (born June 11, 1956), nicknamed “Joe Cool” and “the Comeback Kid”, is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for 16 seasons, primarily with the San Francisco 49ers. He also played for Kansas City Chiefs. After winning a national championship at Notre Dame, Montana started his NFL career in 1979 with San Francisco, where he played for the next 14 seasons. While a member of the 49ers, Montana started and won four Super Bowls and was the first player ever to have been named Super Bowl Most Valuable Player three times. He also holds Super Bowl career records for most passes without an interception (122 in four games) and the all-time highest passer rating of 127.8. In 1993, Montana was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs for his final two seasons, and he led that franchise to its first AFC Championship Game in January 1994. Montana was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2000, his first year of eligibility.</p><p>Though the Miami Dolphins finished the 1972 NFL season with no losses, the regular season at the time comprised only 14 games.

Despite his limited playing time the previous year, Montana performed well during the 1975 spring practice.

During Parseghian’s tenure, Notre Dame had won the NCAA national championship in 1966 and 1973. Parseghian’s success as a coach helped him recruit highly talented players. Though Montana was a top prospect, under Notre Dame policy in 1974 freshmen were not permitted to practice with or play on the varsity team, and consequently Montana appeared only in a few freshman team games. Montana’s first significant contributions to the Notre Dame football team came during his sophomore year.</p><p>Devine did not feel Montana was ready to be the full-time starter in 1975; however, Montana played a key role in Notre Dame’s victory over North Carolina. During the game, played in Chapel Hill, Montana came in with 5:11 left to play. At the time, North Carolina led by a score of 14–6. Montana spent one minute and two seconds of game time on the field. In that time, he had 129 passing yards and Notre Dame won the game, 21–14.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Joe Montana height</b> Not available right now.

While at Ringgold, Montana played football, baseball, and basketball. Montana showed potential as a basketball player and helped Ringgold win the 1973 WPIAL Class AAA boys’ basketball championship while being named an all-state player. He was so good that during his senior year, North Carolina State offered Montana a basketball scholarship. Although Montana turned down the scholarship, he seriously considered NCSU because of a promise that he could play both basketball and football for the university.</p><p align=justify>When the 1977 season began, Montana was the third quarterback listed on the team’s depth chart, behind Rusty Lisch and Gary Forystek. Notre Dame won their season opener and then lost to Mississippi by a score of 20–13. Montana did not appear in either of those games. In their third game of the season, Notre Dame played Purdue. Lisch started and was then replaced by Forystek. In one play, Forystek suffered a broken vertebra, a broken clavicle, and a severe concussion; it was the last play of Forystek’s sports career. Devine inserted Lisch back into the game before Montana finally had the opportunity to play. Montana entered with approximately 11 minutes remaining and Purdue leading 24–14; he threw for 154 yards and one touchdown, and Notre Dame won the game, 31–24.</p><h2>Who is Joe Montana Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Joe Montana</strong> married to <strong>Jennifer Montana , Cass Castillo , Kim Moses </strong>.
