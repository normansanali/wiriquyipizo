The brand new show brings patients who are living treacherous lives impacted by troublesome tumors. Who is her husband? How old is she now? How much is her net worth?</p><p>Tag along and read all about her in this article below.</p><h3><strong>Kimberly Moore Dalal On TLC’s Take My Tumor</strong></h3><p>TLC is known for creating a peculiar form of content relating to marriage and health and is one of the newest additions to its collection of Take My Tumor. The focus of the show is on patients whose lives have been significantly impacted by troublesome tumors. As the teaser for the show mentions, one to five percent of people get soft tissue tumors. Since a tumor is by definition a growth, some patients are frightened to go out in public because of how painful and enormous some of these tumors have become.</p><p>The three resident surgeons on the show, Drs. Kimberly Moore Dalal, Jason Cohen, and Ryan F. Osborne meet with a new patient in each episode. These doctors will do the surgery, but it won’t be simple, and frequently these patients’ lives are in jeopardy. On April 3, 2024, the series debuted on TLC.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Kimberly Moore Dalal Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Kimberly Moore Dalal’s career in the medical field has helped her accumulate a net worth above $3 million. She is a surgical oncologist and board-certified general surgeon with extensive clinical experience and research interests in pancreas and hepatobiliary and upper gastrointestinal (esophagus and stomach) cancer as well as soft tissue sarcoma and melanoma.</p><p>She was a surgeon in the armed services before beginning her career as a surgical oncologist at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation in Burlingame, California, where she completed a fellowship.</p><p>Dr. Dalal has been in practice for more than 20 years. She has hospital affiliations with California Pacific Medical Center and Mills-Peninsula Medical Center and medical affiliations with Palo Alto Medical Foundation –&nbsp; Mills-Peninsula Division and Sutter Medical Network.</p><p>Dr. Dalal earned a biology B.A. from Harvard University and a medical degree from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. She interned at <span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>University of California, San Francisco.</span></p><p>Furthermore, Dr. Dalal is also a fellow of Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for Physicians/Harvard Medical School, Surgical Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, and Sutter Health Leadership Academy.</p><p>Moreover, she has also published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Annals of Surgery, Annals of Surgical Oncology, and have lectured on these topics nationally and internationally.</p><p>For her work, Dr. Dalal received the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Chairman’s Award for Excellence in Clinical Research and ASCO Merit Awards. She was deployed to Afghanistan while serving as Chief of Surgical Oncology at David Grant U.S. Air Force Medical Center, and she held this position before becoming a Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Air Force.</p><h3><strong>Kimberly Moore Dalal Age</strong></h3><p>Born in 1970, Kimberly Moore Dalal reached the age of 53 in 2023.</p><h3><strong>Kimberly Moore Dalal Family</strong></h3><p>Kimberly Moore Dalal is the daughter of Richard Alan Moore and Kisuk Kim Moore who reportedly married on June 23, 1969. Her father is an American public relations professional and a National Guard officer. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Radio and Television Journalism magna cum laude, U. North Dakota, 1969.</p><p>Furthermore, Richard earned a Master of Arts in Political Science and International Relations (University fellow), U. Maine, 1970. He graduated from the United States Army Command and General Staff College, in 1980.</p><p>Kimberly has a sister named Heidi Sue Moore. Dr. Heidi is a pediatrician in San Rafael, CA. She offers primary medical care for children of all ages, from toddlers to&nbsp;teens.</p><h3><strong>Is Kimberly Moore Dalal Married?</strong></h3><p>Kimberly Moore Dalal is married to her husband Dr. Anupam Dalal.</p><p>Kimberly was thinking about alternative less difficult specializations that would allow for a two-physician family, with her taking a reduced role and assuming most of the childcare, as she had a serious boyfriend before meeting Anupam. She chose her work without an engagement ring, without getting married, and without having kids. When the relationship ended, those ideas crumbled.</p><p>Seven years later, Kimberly was engaged to Anupam. At the same time, she applied to several of the top surgical oncology fellowships in the country. When she matched in the premier training program, located in New York City, she told Anupam, “Maybe I should stay in Boston with you?”</p><p>Anupam replied: “No. You need to go to the best program for your career.”</p><p>Kimberly is beyond grateful for that.</p><p>Now, she is happily married and shares two children; a boy and a girl with her husband.</p><p>Speaking of Anupam, he works for Acuta Capital Partners LLC as the Chief Investment Officer. He oversees investments in healthcare, concentrating on biotech. As a major investor, he has over 16 years of experience in the healthcare industry. Dr. Dalal was a managing director at the healthcare-focused venture capital firm Kearny Venture Partners before joining Acuta Capital.</p><p>In addition, he founded and served as a managing member of KVP Capital, an investment entity that specialized in opportunities related to public biopharmaceuticals. He was a principal at Flagship Ventures before joining KVP.</p><p>Anupam received an M.D. from the University of California in San Francisco with honors; an M.B.A., with distinction, from Harvard Business School; and a B.A. in Economics, Phi Beta Kappa and highest honors, from the University of California, Berkeley.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Kimberly Moore Dalal On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>No, Kimberly is not on Instagram but she has a Facebook page (<a href=#>@kimberly.dalal</a>).</p><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Kimberly Moore Dalal Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Kimberly celebrates her birthday in September.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Kimberly Moore Dalal From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Kimberly is originally from Hillsborough, California.
