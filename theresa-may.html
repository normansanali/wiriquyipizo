After completing her high school she graduated from the University of Oxford in 1977. After collecting her degree she spent the next 20 years working in the financial sector. She was elected as Conservative MP (Member of Parliament) of Maidenhead in 1997, describing herself as a “One-Nation Conservative.”</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><h4>Political Career</h4><p>Theresa May was appointed as the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Conservative Party’s </a>first female chairman in 2002. She even was famously quoted as saying that it should no longer be called the “Nasty Party.”Likewise, she served in several Shadow Cabinets before becoming Home Secretary in 2010. She had also become the Minister for Women and Equalities, a post she vacated in 2012.</p><p>After Prime Minister David Cameron announced his resignation, May announced his candidacy for the Conservative Party and quickly emerged as its Leader, receiving 50% of the votes alone in Parliament amid the other candidates.</p><h4>‘Brexit’ and PM Candidacy</h4><p>Surprisingly half of the citizens of the UK voted to exit the European Union in June 2016 — an event which is referred to as the “Brexit” (Britain Exit) referendum.&nbsp; There, she originally voted to remain in the E.U., although she was known to be a “Euroskeptic.” However, she announced her candidacy for the Conservative Party after Prime Minister David Cameron announced his resignation. As well as quickly emerged as its frontrunner, receiving 50 percent of the Parliamentary votes alone amid the other candidates.</p><p>Similarly, she along with fellow Conservative leader Andrea Leadsom would both be in contention to become the country’s next PM on July 7, 2016. Unfortunately, within days, Leadsom, who voted for Britain to leave the E.U., pulled out of the running due to distasteful remarks she made about why she would make a better PM. Without any other contesting her candidacy, she was set to be sworn in as the first post-Brexit female Prime Minister.</p><h5>Saying at the Parliament</h5><p>Additionally, Theresa May had even made a televised announcement surrounded by Members of Parliament and her husband Philip, about seeing Brexit through on July 11, 2016, saying,</p><p>“During this campaign, my case has been based on three things. First, the need for strong, proven leadership to steer us through what will be difficult and uncertain economic and political times. The need, of course, to negotiate the best deal for Britain in leaving the E.U. and to forge a new role for ourselves in the world. Brexit means Brexit. And we are going to make a success of it.”</p><p>“Second, we need to unite our country. And third, we need a strong, new positive vision for the future of our country. A vision of a country that works, not for the privileged few, but that works for every one of us. Because we’re going to give people more control over their lives. And that’s how, together, we will build a better Britain.”</p><h4>Reign as Prime Minister</h4><p>May was sworn in as Britain’s second female Prime Minister on July 13, 2016. As well as the Queen’s 13th Prime Minister following ceremonial overtures.</p><p>On May 29, 2017, Prime Minister May officially told Parliament that she had invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, legislation triggering the legal process to set Brexit in motion. “This is a historic moment from which there can be no turning back. Britain is leaving the European Union,” she said. “We are going to make our own decisions and our laws. We will take control of the most important things for us. And we will take this opportunity to build a stronger, fairer Britain — a country that our kids and grandkids are proud to call home. union.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-19533 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Theresa-May-with-the-world-cup.jpg alt="Theresa May" width=650 height=434 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-19533 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Theresa May with the World Cup team of England (Source: Instagram)</p><p>Shortly afterward, on June 8, an early general election resulted in the loss of her Conservative Party’s Parliamentary majority. In November, the PM faced additional troubles with the resignation of two cabinet ministers — Secretary of State for International Development <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Priti Patel</a> and Secretary of State for Defence Sir Michael Fallon— seven days in length.</p><p>In early December, a report surfaced that MI5, the British domestic intelligence agency, had foiled a terrorist plot to assassinate May. According to the report, two men were planning to use improvised explosives to blow up the gate at the prime minister’s residence and kill her in the ensuing chaos. The two suspects were arrested in late November.</p><h2><span id=Brexit_Setbacks>Brexit Setbacks</span></h2><p>During the year of 2013, she suffered another setback in the ongoing Brexit process. Besides requesting maximum leeway to negotiate with E.U. leaders over terms of departure the parliament also rejected her. They said that any final deal to withdraw is submitted via legislation. Due to this, she was viewed to have diminished leverage heading into her discussions with the E.U.</p><p>In the year 2018, she butted heads with Donald Trump. And sought to present a more unified front with the American president at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Similarly, Trump praised their “great relationship,” where she cited the importance of maintaining a strong alliance. She even said,</p><p>“We face the same challenges across the world, and as you say we’re willing to go and to defeat those challenges and meet them.”</p><p>Similarly, she was set to chair the first of two Brexit meetings with senior ministers to outline the parameters of a relationship between the U.K. and E.U in early February. Due to the businesses applying pressure on the government to provide a clear strategy, the cabinet aimed to hash out differences on whether to go for “clean” separation. And had to strike new trade deals, or retain close access to the single market.</p><h4>Historic Defeat</h4><p>By the year 2019, just 10 weeks before Britain was scheduled to leave the bloc, she had suffered a historic defeat in Parliament. From which she got rejected her proposed Brexit deal by a vote of 432 to 202 by lawmakers.</p><p>Additionally, she had to back off on some of her Brexit demands by March. The two sides outlined a provisional agreement in which the U.K. would retain the benefits of the single market and customs union, with Northern Ireland remaining under E.U. law to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.&nbsp; And by the end of March, she reportedly said she would resign if her withdrawal plan received the approval of lawmakers.</p><h4>Resignation</h4><p>May had announced that she was resigning as Prime Minister. And leader of the Conservative Party on the 24th of May 2019. She even had &nbsp;differences across Parliament and within her party where she said:</p><p>“I believe it was right to persevere, even when the odds against success seemed high. But it is now clear to me that it is in the best interests of the country for a new Prime Minister to lead that effort.”</p><p>“I will shortly leave the job that it has been the honor of my life to hold — the second female Prime Minister but certainly not the last. I do so with no ill will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love.”</p><p>After this speech, she formally stepped down from her post on July 24, 2019. She had given way her post to new Prime Minister Boris Johnson.</p><h2><span id=Brand_Endorsements>Brand Endorsements</span></h2><p>The former UK president is also involved in brand endorsement activities.
