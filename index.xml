Proper thermal testing cannot be performed with a cooler mounted on a single chip, for multiple reasons. Some of these reasons include the instability of the thermal load and the inability to fully control and or monitor it, as well as the inaccuracy of the chip-integrated sensors. It is also impossible to compare results taken on different chips, let alone entirely different systems, which is a great problem when testing computer coolers, as the hardware changes every several months.</description></item><item><title>The Bear Spirit Animal</title><link>/bear-spirit-animal.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/bear-spirit-animal.html</guid><description>Interested in the bear spirit animal meanings?
