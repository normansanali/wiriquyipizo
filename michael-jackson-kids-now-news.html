His eldest, <strong>Michael "Prince" Jackson Jr.</strong> is 24, his daughter <strong>Paris Jackson</strong> is 22, and his youngest son, <strong>Bigi Jackson</strong> (formerly known as Blanket) is 19. And while they're the children of the biggest pop star of all time, they've all gone on different paths when it comes to how much they want to be in the public eye.</p><p>Paris has become a musician and actor. Prince isn't in the entertainment business, but does share details about his life on social media. And Bigi doesn't have a public social media account, so not as much is known about him. Jackson welcomed Paris and Prince with his wife <strong>Debbie Rowe</strong>, and Bigi through a surrogate. The children were all still young when Jackson died in 2009 at age 50.</p><p>Read on to see what the three Jackson siblings are up to now.

He <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>graduated from Loyola Marymount University</a> in 2019 "Cum Laude in the school of business with a focus on entrepreneurship," as he explained on Instagram.</p><p>"If I did [think of becoming an artist], my family would be very honest and tell me that it's not for you," Prince said in <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>a recent interview</a> with Fox Soul. "I don't have the voice for singing and it took me a while to learn what a beat was, but I got that down at least. I just can't dance."</p><p>Instead, Prince is focused on charity work. When he was in college he co-founded <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Heal Los Angeles Foundation</a>, which helps provide meals to those in need. He is also an avid motorcyclist, which he posts about often on social media.</p><p>Prince has been in a relationship with his girlfriend for four years. He <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>posted about their anniversary</a> on Instagram on Mar. 23 and shared a series of photos of them traveling.</p><p>For more on children who grew up in the spotlight, check out&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>19 Celebrity Kids on Their First Red Carpet</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Paris-Jackson.png><p>Of the Jackson children, Paris is the most famous. She's worked as a model, actor, and singer. Paris appeared on the TV series Star and Scream, in the film Gringo, and is <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>signed with IMG Models</a>.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>But, it's music that is her main focus right now. She recently <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>released her first album</a>, titled Wilted. In a interview with Variety, she described the album as "just a good starting point" and said if she had to name a genre, "I'd say it's more alternative folk, but I don't plan on staying with just that." She explained, "I want to keep growing. I want to keep expanding. I want to keep experimenting. I want to try as many things as I can, while staying true to myself and what I think sounds and feels right."</p><p>Paris has been <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>very open about her struggles</a> over the years, including substance use disorder and self-harm. In <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>a 2020 interview</a> with NPR, she said she had to come to the realization that people would pre-judge her because of who she is and that she can't make everyone happy. "It took a really long time for me to finally get to a point where I'm like, OK, well, can't please everyone. If I go left, I'm wrong. If I go right, I'm wrong. So I might as well just be myself."</p><p>For more celebrity news delivered right to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Prince-and-Bigi-Jackson.png><p>Bigi's life is far more private than that of his siblings. Information about him has come either through his family or through the odd news report. For instance, in March 2020, Today reported that Bigi had <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>purchased a $2.6 million home</a> in Calabasas, California.</p><p>His siblings have posted about Bigi on their own social media. In February 2020, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Paris wished Bigi a happy birthday</a> by posting a series of photos. She wrote in the caption, "my little brother is a legal adult today. what the f***. i used to change his diapers. this is such a trip. proud of the handsome, intelligent, insightful, funny, and kind young man he has become. he likes privacy so that's all i gotta say. hbd lil bro."</p><p>For more siblings of stars who prefer to keep things private, read <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Celebrity Siblings Who Avoid the Spotlight</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Jackson-siblings.png><p>The siblings remain close. When Prince graduated from college, he <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>posted a photo of Bigi</a> there celebrating with him. Paris also recently <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>posted about Prince's birthday</a> and called him "my hero." In a 2020 interview with Good Morning America, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Paris shared how much it means to her</a> that Prince likes her music. "I've always looked up to him and always wanted his approval and everything, and wanted to be more like him. So to hear him approve, not just approve but enjoy what I do, it's everything to me," she said.</p><p>Read about more famous families with&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>13 Celebrities You Had No Idea Were Related</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmpqGTna6muIyjmJyjo6S7brfInapmpp%2Bseq%2Bx1qxm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmichael-jackson-kids-now-news.html&text=See%20What%20Michael%20Jackson%27s%20Three%20Kids%20Look%20Like%20All%20Grown%20Up%20%20Best%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-jackson-kids-now-news.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-jackson-kids-now-news.html&title=See%20What%20Michael%20Jackson%27s%20Three%20Kids%20Look%20Like%20All%20Grown%20Up%20%20Best%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmichael-jackson-kids-now-news.html&title=See%20What%20Michael%20Jackson%27s%20Three%20Kids%20Look%20Like%20All%20Grown%20Up%20%20Best%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-jackson-kids-now-news.html&title=See%20What%20Michael%20Jackson%27s%20Three%20Kids%20Look%20Like%20All%20Grown%20Up%20%20Best%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-jackson-kids-now-news.html&description=See%20What%20Michael%20Jackson%27s%20Three%20Kids%20Look%20Like%20All%20Grown%20Up%20%20Best%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./valerie-truong-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-460958-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Valerie Truong Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dominic-sena.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Movies directed by Dominic Sena">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
