He could throw the heck out of the ball, however, so in schoolyard games, he usually ended up playing quarterback or pitcher.

A. Happ and two minor league players center fielders on July 29.&nbsp;Prior to this, he becomes the first Phillies pitcher to field in a non-pitching position in 39 years. In a game against the Houston Astros, Phillies’ first baseman Ryan Howard gets an ejection after arguing a checked swing to end the top of the 15th inning.</p><p>Out of offensive reserves, however, the Phillies moves left fielder Raúl Ibañez to first base and sends Oswalt to play left field. Citing this, Oswalt acquires one putout in the outfield.&nbsp;Nonetheless, he hits into the final out of the Phillies lost by grounding out in the bottom of the 16th inning. On September 12, Oswalt pitches his first complete game as a Phillie in a 3–0 win against the New York Mets.</p><p>In addition, he pitches Game 2 of the Phillies’ three-game sweep of the Cincinnati Reds during the 2010 NLDS. Furthermore, he gives up 4 runs in 5 innings, but the Phillies come back to win 7–4.&nbsp;In the 2010 NLCS against the San Francisco Giants, Oswalt wins Game 2 by allowing only 1 run in 8 innings. Moreover, he enters Game 4 in the bottom of the ninth inning, attempting to preserve a tie game, but takes the loss.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><h2 id=h-roy-oswalt-hall-of-fame>Roy Oswalt Hall of Fame</h2><p>There’s no way the driver just said what you think he said.

The Astros right-hander is five years into his career, he’s 28 and he’s talking about the possibility of walking away from baseball at age 33.

Oswalt has racked up back-to-back 20-win seasons, and his career-winning percentage is .680.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>He propelled himself into the national consciousness last fall by blowing away the Cardinals in Game 6 of the NLCS. “Millions of viewers might have learned who Roy was that night,” says catcher Brad Ausmus, “but there’s not a guy in the National League who didn’t know how good he was before that.”</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-915 data-method=placement-service></span><p>A guy this good talking about walking away in five years? When he might be making $15 million a year on the foundation of a Hall of Fame career?
