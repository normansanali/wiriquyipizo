Surprisingly, he spends more time in his van traveling than living in his home.</p><p>In 2014, he went to Squamish, Canada, for summer vacation.</p><p>Similarly, Honnold was in Greece for a short trip in 2020.</p><p>He traveled to Scotland for a work event before heading to Sardinia, where he spent the final two weeks of his sport climbing vacation in 2021.</p><h2>Alex Honnold | Charity</h2><p>Alex started “The Honnold Foundation” in 2012.</p><p>He spent hours crouched over his laptop at home after treks to Chad and Borneo, researching carbon offsets, environmental advocacy, energy access, and philanthropic giving.</p><p>Hence, he made the decision to focus on solar energy and started donating a third of his income to solar projects that widened access to energy globally.</p><p>The charity also supports neighborhood-scale initiatives that enhance climatic resilience, promote social and economic fairness, lessen environmental impact, and enhance people’s lives.</p><p><strong>Read About&nbsp;<a href=# rel=bookmark>Mikaela Shiffrin’s Net Worth: Career & Lifestyle</a></strong></p><h2>Alex Honnold | Movies, Books, and Endorsement</h2><h3>Movies</h3><p>Alex starred in “Valley Uprising,” a 2014 documentary that captured the development of rock climbing in Yosemite Park.</p><p>Clif Bar was one of the project’s financial sponsors and had sponsorship agreements with five participants, including Honnold.</p><p>However, a few months after the movie’s debut, Clif Bar ended its sponsorship agreements with the climbers.</p><p>They claimed that they made this decision because the corporation didn’t like how far the climbers were pushing the activity’s limits and thought they were taking unnecessarily high risks.</p><p>Alex is renowned for taking tremendous risks for his life and safety while maintaining a seemingly carefree attitude.</p><p>He used the 2,900-foot Freerider route to make the first free solo ascent of El Capitan on June 3rd, 2017.</p><p>His achievement has been hailed as one of the most impressive athletic accomplishments ever. He finished the ascent in 3 hours and 56 minutes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Free-Solo.jpg><p>Jimmy Chin, a climber and photographer, and his wife Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, a documentary filmmaker, documented it.</p><p>In 2018, they released the documentary film “Free Solo.” That year, it took home the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature.</p><p>Alex has also been featured in television series like “Billions” (2022)” and “Duncanville” (2020).</p><p>His new virtual reality movie, “Alex Honnold: The Soloist VR,” was released in 2022.</p><p>The movie allows fans to follow along as he does free-solo climbs in the French and Italian Alps.</p><h3>Books</h3><p>Alex has released two popular books in his career.</p><p>In 2015, Honnold published his first book, “<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Alone on the Wall</a>,” which explains his career, struggle, and achievements.</p><p>Likewise, Honnold’s second book is the 2019 “El Capitan: The Greatest Rock Climb in the World!”</p><h3>Endorsements</h3><p>Honnold has been the subject of articles for the “New York Times” and “60 Minutes” and has appeared on the covers of “National Geographic” and in commercials that have aired overseas.</p><p>He has been sponsored by “Black Diamond,” “<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The North Face</a>,” “<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">La Sportiva</a>,” “Ando,” and “Stride Health.” He even has a line of climbing shoes under the “<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Evolv</a>.”</p><p>Moreover, he is a board member of El Cap Climbing Gyms.</p><h2>Alex Honnold | Career</h2><p>Even though he had competed in climbing for much of his life, until roughly 2007, Alex was hardly known outside the climbing world.</p><p>He free soloed Astroman and Rostrum in Yosemite Valley that year, a feat only surpassed by climber Peter Croft in 1987.</p><p>Only after this success, he started to receive greater attention from the climbing community.</p><p>The following year, he free soloed a 1,200-feet-tall finger crack that separates Zion’s Moonlight Buttress.</p><p>When this accomplishment was announced, many people assumed it was a joke because of the climb’s great difficulty and the date of the announcement, which was on April 1.</p><p>Later in 2008, Honnold free soloed Yosemite’s Half Dome’s 2,000-feet-tall Regular Northwest Face.</p><h2>Some Interesting Facts About Alex Honnold</h2><ul><li>Alex doesn’t take any drugs or drink alcohol.</li><li>He enjoys reading widely and is passionate about economics, environmentalism, and classic literature.</li><li>Honnold identifies himself as a feminist and atheist.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What is Alex Honnold’s diet plan?</h3><p>Honnold follows a vegetarian diet that is very comparable to a vegan one.
