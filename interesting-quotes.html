There are no limits. There are only plateaus; and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. - Bruce Lee</span> <span class=caption-body>"I'm bored" is a useless thing to say. I mean, you live in a great, big, vast world that you've seen none percent of. Even the inside of your own mind is endless; it goes on forever, inwardly, do you understand? The fact that you're alive is amazing, so you don't get to say 'I'm bored.' - Louis CK</span> <span class=caption-body>How lucky am I to have something that makes saying goodbye hard. - Winnie The Pooh</span> <span class=caption-body>This is my simple religion.

So that we are all connected to each other biologically, to the earth chemically and to the rest of the universe atomically. That's kinda cool! That makes me smile and I actually feel quite large at the end of that. It’s not that we are better than the universe, we are part of the universe.

Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea. - Antoine de Saint</span> <span class=caption-body>You'll be fine. You're 25. Feeling unsure and lost is part of your path. Don't avoid it.

Life should be something that you love. - Charles Eisenstein</span> <span class=caption-body>I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein’s brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops. - Stephen Jay Gould</span> <span class=caption-body>I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you. - Neil DeGrasse Tyson</span> <span class=caption-body>When you're 20 you care what everyone thinks, when you're 40 you stop caring what everyone thinks, when you're 60 you realize no one was ever thinking about you in the first place.</span> <span class=caption-body>You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life. - Winston Churchill</span> <span class=caption-body>In every block of marble I see a statue as plain as though it stood before me, shaped and perfect in attitude and action. I have only to hew away the rough walls that imprison the lovely apparition to reveal it to the other eyes as mine see it. - Michelangelo</span> <span class=caption-body>The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it. - Albert Einstein</span> <span class=caption-body>So avoid using the word 'very' because it’s lazy. A man is not very tired, he is exhausted. Don't use very sad, use morose. Language was invented for one reason, boys - to woo women - and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do. It also won't do in your essays.</span> <span class=caption-body>What you do today is important, because you are sacrificing a day of your life for it.</span> <span class=caption-body>Anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured. - Mark Twain</span> <span class=caption-body>When you feel happy, really happy, it somehow seems that you've always been happy and that you'll always be happy.

If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones. - Marcus Aurelius</span> <span class=caption-body>You should sit in meditation for 20 minutes a day, unless you're too busy, then you should sit for an hour.</span> <span class=caption-body>If Tetris has taught me anything, it's that errors pile up and accomplishments disappear.</span> <span class=caption-body>Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. - Mike Tyson</span> <span class=caption-body>You can't have everything you want, but you can have the things that really matter to you. - Marissa Mayer</span> <span class=caption-body>Most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be. - Abraham Lincoln</span> <span class=caption-body>Women who seek to be equal with men lack ambition. - Timothy Leary</span> <span class=caption-body>Write drunk.

In a world of thieves, the only final sin is stupidity. - Hunter S. Thompson</span> <span class=caption-body>Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. - Steve Jobs</span> <span class=caption-body>Intelligence without ambition is a bird without wings. - Salvadore Dali</span> <span class=caption-body>I refuse to accept other people’s ideas of happiness for me.

Hack away at the unessential. - Bruce Lee</span> <span class=caption-body>If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said "faster horses". - Henry Ford</span> <span class=caption-body>But the fact that some geniuses were laughed at does not imply that all who are laughed at are geniuses.

Lewis</span> <span class=caption-body>In the US, there is basically one party - the business party. It has two factions, called Democrats and Republicans, which are somewhat different but carry out variations on the same policies. By and large, I am opposed to those policies. As is most of the population. - Noam Chomsky</span> <span class=caption-body>The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion. - Albert Camus</span> <span class=caption-body>That's the best revenge of all: happiness. Nothing drives people crazier than seeing someone have a good fucking life. - Chuck Palahniuk</span> <span class=caption-body>They say you die twice.

It's like, 'No dude, YOU are fucking awesome!' - Bill Burr</span> <span class=caption-body>Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't. - Bill Nye</span> <span class=caption-body>The truth is, everyone is going to hurt you. You just got to find the ones worth suffering for. - Bob Marley</span> <span class=caption-body>Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. - Carl Sagan</span> <span class=caption-body>If you want to know who your friends are, get yourself a jail sentence. - Charles Bukowski</span> <span class=caption-body>Here’s to the crazy ones — the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently — they’re not fond of rules. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they change things. They push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do. - Steve Jobs</span> 100 of 101 101 of 101<p class=social-callout>Like this gallery?<br>Share it:</p><img decoding=async alt="Interesting Quotes" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img///allthatsinteresting.com/thumb/630.501.allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/interesting-quotes.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> 99 Interesting Quotes That Will Open Your Mind View Gallery<p class=dropcaps>While we can't take all of our wisdom from just a few choice words, or even choice sentences, there's just something about a perfectly phrased quote that can open our minds and our hearts, causing us to think and feel things we may not have even thought possible before.</p><p>Interesting quotes like these — especially when they come from luminaries like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Albert Einstein</a>, Steve Jobs, or Neil DeGrasse Tyson — can actually shape how we see the world. These words can define who we are and who we will become.</p><p>Whether these quotes come from the world of science, politics, the arts, and beyond, they are the words that we live by. But, sometimes, the words we live by don't come from such lofty places at all, but instead from the world of pop culture. After all, just because the following was said by Homer Simpson doesn't make it any less poignant: "Sometime, when you least expect it, you'll realize that someone loved you.
