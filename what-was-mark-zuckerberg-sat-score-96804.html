His perfect SAT score saw him attending Harvard University, where he would go on to create a little social media site known as Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg | Frederic Legrand – COMEO / Shutterstock.com</p><p>Other estimates place Mark Zuckerberg’s intelligence score at 160+. This is largely based on his reported perfect SAT score of<strong> 1,600</strong>. While the type of questions that can be found on the SAT can also be found on IQ tests, not all IQ test question types are found on IQ tests.</p><h2>What is the average SAT score for 2019?</h2><p>Celebrity SAT scores hold no weight in determining what a good SAT score is for you. Overall, the average SAT score in 2019 was<strong> 1060.</strong> In addition, the CollegeBoard has set benchmarks for college readiness at a math score of 530 and an evidence based reading and writing score of 480.</p><p>While this may seem unscrupulous, both Obama and Trump are within their rights to keep their transcripts and test scores to themselves. All student records are protected under the 1974 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, so no president (or any person, for that matter) is required to release them.</p><h2>How much did Stephen King score on his SATs?</h2><p>Stephen King: The man’s written countless classics, so it’s not surprising that he’s got a big brain up there. The author reportedly scored<strong> 1300</strong> on his SATs, which got him into the University of Maine.</p><p><strong>Paul Allen </strong>: The late Microsoft co-founder and owner of the Seattle Seahawks also scored a perfect 1600 on his SATS, according to powerscore.com. But even so, he ended up dropping out of Washington State University.</p><p>Derek Jeter: His thing is<strong> Baseball,</strong> but he’s not just in physical shape – he’s got a well-exercised brain, too. He reportedly scored 1200 on his SATs, getting him into the prestigious University of Michigan.</p><p>Meredith Vieira: The journalist launched her successful career after getting into Tufts University, with a little help from her solid SAT score of<strong> 1300.</strong></p><p>Ke$ha: The pop star could have picked and chosen just about any college with her high SAT score of<strong> 1500 </strong>… but she answered when the music called, dropping out of high school just before graduating.</p><p>Ben Affleck: The Oscar-winning actor attended the<strong> University of Vermont & Occidental</strong> College… and supposedly scored a perfect 1600 on his SATs. Will Smith: The actor said in his Biography channel profile that he scored 1600 on his SATs, too.</p><p>Bill Gates: As for Allen’s counterpart, Gates scored just under his Microsoft co-founder with 1590. And similarly, he also dropped out… of Harvard. We don’t feel bad for the guy, though, things turned out just fine for the second-richest man in the world!</p><h2>What did Mark Zuckerberg learn in high school?</h2><p>Zuckerberg took a<strong> graduate course in the subject at Mercy College</strong> near his home while still in high school. In one program, since his father’s dental practice was operated from their home, he built a software program he called “ZuckNet” that allowed all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other. It is considered a “primitive” version of AOL ‘s Instant Messenger, which came out the following year.</p><p>Born in White Plains, New York, Zuckerberg attended<strong> Harvard University,</strong> where he launched the Facebook social networking service from his dormitory room on February 4, 2004, with college roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The New Yorker noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard in 2002, he had already achieved a “reputation as a programming prodigy.” He studied<strong> psychology and computer science</strong> and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi and Kirkland House. In his sophomore year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups. A short time later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. According to Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg’s roommate at the time, “he built the site for fun.” Hasit explains:</p><p>On September 22, 2010, it was reported that Zuckerberg had donated<strong> $100 million</strong> to Newark Public Schools, the public school system of Newark, New Jersey. Critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of The Social Network, which painted a somewhat negative portrait of Zuckerberg.</p><p>As of July 2021, Zuckerberg’s net worth is<strong> $132 billion,</strong> making him the 5th-richest person in the world. Since 2008, Time magazine has named Zuckerberg among the 100 most influential people in the world as a part of its Person of the Year award.</p><p>Stephen Colbert awarded a “Medal of Fear” to Zuckerberg at the Rally to<strong> Restore Sanity and/or Fear</strong> on October 30, 2010, “because he values his privacy much more than he values yours”. Zuckerberg appears in the climax of the documentary film Terms and Conditions May Apply.</p><p>During Zuckerberg’s high-school years, he worked under the company name Intelligent Media Group to build a music player called the<strong> Synapse Media Player.</strong> The device used machine learning to learn the user’s listening habits, which was posted to Slashdot and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGiuoZmkYsSiv4ymmKujXa%2FCpLfEq5meqpdiwKLAjKyaqKqVYoZ3hI9tZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-was-mark-zuckerberg-sat-score-96804.html&text=What%20Was%20Mark%20Zuckerberg%20Sat%20Score%3f%20%20Celebrity&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-was-mark-zuckerberg-sat-score-96804.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-was-mark-zuckerberg-sat-score-96804.html&title=What%20Was%20Mark%20Zuckerberg%20Sat%20Score%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-was-mark-zuckerberg-sat-score-96804.html&title=What%20Was%20Mark%20Zuckerberg%20Sat%20Score%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-was-mark-zuckerberg-sat-score-96804.html&title=What%20Was%20Mark%20Zuckerberg%20Sat%20Score%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-was-mark-zuckerberg-sat-score-96804.html&description=What%20Was%20Mark%20Zuckerberg%20Sat%20Score%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./where-is-esai-morales-now-what-happened-to-him-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where is Esai Morales now?
