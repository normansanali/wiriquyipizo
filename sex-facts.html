Considering just how big a role sex plays in the human experience, for the most part, it gets largely ignored in history.</p><p>Sure, a high school history book might briefly touch on the sexual revolution of the 1960s or gloss over the polygamy of ancient Greece, but how about Cleopatra's bee-filled vibrator?

This surge in the world's oldest profession resulted in the creation of everything from pubic hair wigs to sex worker classifieds.</p><p>If the sex facts above prove anything, it's that sex has been and always will be fundamental to our collective history.</p><p>Enjoy these interesting sex facts?
